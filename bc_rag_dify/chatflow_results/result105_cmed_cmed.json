  "ai_answer": "乳腺钼靶提示“双乳增生改变伴双乳散在钙化点”，双乳增生是乳腺常见的良性病变表现，而散在钙化点需要进一步明确其性质。单纯的乳腺增生和散在良性钙化通常不代表严重情况，但钙化有良性和恶性之分，所以不能直接判定是否为乳腺癌早期症状。根据临床诊疗规范，这种情况建议结合临床医生的综合评估，通常会建议进行穿刺活检（如空心针穿刺活检）来明确钙化的性质，从而确定后续是继续观察还是进一步治疗等。在康复锻炼方面，若后续明确无恶性病变，可进行适度的乳腺相关康复锻炼，如简单的扩胸运动等；营养支持上要保持均衡饮食，多摄入蔬菜水果等；心理方面要保持放松，避免过度焦虑，可通过与家人朋友沟通等方式进行心理疏导。如果通过穿刺明确为良性情况，定期复查乳腺钼靶等检查即可；若为恶性，则需按照乳腺癌的诊疗规范进行相应的手术、放化疗等综合治疗。",
