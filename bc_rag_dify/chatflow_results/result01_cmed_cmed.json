  "ai_answer": "月经前出现乳房胀痛、腋窝痛以及乳头溢液（白色液体），多与月经前体内激素水平波动有关，比如泌乳素等激素的变化可能导致这种情况，但也不能完全排除乳腺疾病的可能。不过目前不要过度恐慌。关于月经对检查的影响，一般来说，如果是进行乳腺超声检查，月经前检查影响不大；但如果是涉及激素水平的检测（如泌乳素等），可能月经前的激素波动会对结果有一定干扰，建议可以在月经干净后3 - 7天左右去医院检查会更合适。现在首先要做的是尽快到正规医院乳腺科就诊，医生会通过详细问诊、乳腺超声等检查来明确乳头溢液的原因。在心理方面要尽量放松，避免过度焦虑，因为焦虑情绪可能会加重乳房不适等症状。同时，在等待就医过程中，要注意避免刺激乳头，保持乳房局部清洁。",
  "ref_answer": "乳头溢液是乳房病的常见症状，溢乳的原因是因为体内催乳素分泌过多。建议你月经过后7至14天去医院进行乳透，看看是否有乳腺疾病，发现问题及时治疗。",
