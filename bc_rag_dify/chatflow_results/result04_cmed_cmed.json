  "question": "我孩子两周岁的时候断奶了，现在我的胸部严重下垂，摸起来和男人没什么两样，现在我都不穿胸罩了，我吃了好多的木瓜可也没啥效果，想去做隆胸手术，可是我以后还打算再要孩子，怕对哺乳有影响，我想问下做隆胸手术以后还可以哺乳吗。",

  "ai_answer": "关于隆胸手术对以后哺乳的影响，一般来说，如果隆胸手术采用的是乳房下皱襞等不涉及乳腺组织和乳腺导管的手术入路，相对对哺乳的影响较小；但如果手术切口涉及到乳腺导管等结构，可能会有一定概率影响哺乳功能。不过这需要具体根据所选择的隆胸手术方式来确定。建议你在考虑进行隆胸手术前，务必前往正规的整形医疗机构，咨询专业的整形医生以及乳腺科医生，进行详细的术前评估，医生会根据你的具体乳房情况、身体状况等综合分析不同隆胸方式对未来哺乳可能产生的影响，从而帮助你做出更合适的决策。同时，在整个过程中要保持理性，充分了解各种风险和可能的情况。",
  "ref_answer": "成功的胸部整形不会影响哺乳。虽然隆胸手术基本不影响日后的哺乳，但是手术如果发生了意外，就很难避免哺乳问题的发生。假体如果因为产品质量问题及外力创伤的作用，破裂后渗入到乳腺组织，引起乳腺的急性炎症，很有可能阻塞乳腺导管，出现排泄不畅。所以建议你去正规的大医院做隆胸手术。",
