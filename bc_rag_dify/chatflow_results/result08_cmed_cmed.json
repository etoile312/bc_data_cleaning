  "ai_answer": "仅根据您描述的乳房左边有肿块、胀痛刺痛、皮肤发红脱皮以及肿块活动性不差这些表现，不能确诊您就是得了乳腺癌。目前您处于疑似患病的术前评估阶段。建议您尽快前往正规医院的乳腺专科就诊，医生通常会先为您进行详细的体格检查，之后可能会安排乳腺超声、乳腺钼靶、乳腺磁共振成像（MRI）等影像学检查，必要时还会进行病理活检来明确肿块的性质。在等待检查结果期间，您要尽量保持心情平静，避免过度焦虑。在康复锻炼方面，目前不建议进行剧烈的胸部相关锻炼；并发症处理方面，若后续确诊乳腺癌，根据不同的治疗方案会有相应的并发症处理措施；营养支持上，要保证均衡饮食，多摄入富含蛋白质、维生素等营养物质的食物；心理疏导很重要，您可以多与家人朋友沟通交流，也可以向专业的心理医生寻求帮助，遵循专业医生依据CSCO等权威指南给出的个性化建议。",
