      "content": "Oncogenic activation of RAS/MAPK is associated with a significant reduction in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and lower survival in TNBC patients, while concomitant MEK inhibition and antiPD1/PD-L1 immunotherapy augmented anti-tumor immunity in preclinical TNBC models (Loi et al., 2016)In addition to the ERK pathway, MAP3K1 can regulate MAPK-JNK signaling through phosphorylation of substrates such as MAP2K4Relatively frequent somatic mutations occur in MAP2K4 and MAP3K1 in luminal cancers (12% in total), often coincident with PIK3CA mutationsWhile JNK pathway activation is predictive of chemotherapy sensitivity in TNBC, recent evidence suggests JNK signaling fosters an immunosuppressive TME to drive tumor progression, implicating JNK-targeted immunotherapy as a potential treatment strategy for TNBC (Semba et al., 2022). Cyclin D1-CDK4/6-RB axis The cyclin D1-CDK4/6-RB axis is the pivotal regulator of the G1-S transition of the cell cycle",

Patients with discordant results (i.e., either high clinical risk and low genomic risk or low clinical risk and high genomic risk) were randomly assigned to the chemotherapy group or the no-chemotherapy group on the basis of either the clinical result or the genomic resultThe treatment randomization used a minimization technique that was stratified according to institution, risk group, hormone-receptor status (ER-positive or progesterone [PR]-positive vs ER-negative and PR-negative), nodal involvement (yes or no), age (<50 years vs≥50 years), HER2 status (HER2-positive vsHER2-negative vsunknown), axillary treatment (sentinel node only vs dissection), and type of surgery (mastectomy vs",

Mean change of the linear transformed scores from baseline—and SEs—were computed for each assessment timepoint. RESULTS From June 2014 to June 2015, 444 patients were randomly assigned (T-DM1+P, n = 223; TCH+P, n = 221; Fig 1 and Appendix Table A1, online only), and all but two patients in the TCH+P arm received one or more dose of study medication.12 Baseline characteristics were balanced between arms (Appendix Table A2, online only)Hormone receptor–positive disease was present in 62.2% of patients, and 83.1% had clinical stage IIA to IIIA disease, 66.4% were white, and 25.2% were Asian",
