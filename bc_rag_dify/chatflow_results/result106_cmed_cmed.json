  "ai_answer": "对于您母亲乳腺癌术后患肢浮肿的情况，首先建议在康复锻炼方面：可以在医生或康复治疗师的指导下进行患肢的康复训练，比如简单的手部握拳、伸展手指、手腕旋转等动作，每天多次进行，以促进淋巴回流。同时，睡觉时可将患肢适当抬高，高于心脏水平，有助于减轻浮肿。另外，要注意避免患肢过度劳累、受伤，避免长时间下垂。可以咨询当地医院的肿瘤专科医生，参考CSCO等相关指南中的术后康复建议。在营养支持上，保证均衡饮食，摄入足够的蛋白质等营养物质，维持身体良好状态。心理方面，家人要多给予关心和疏导，帮助患者缓解因浮肿带来的焦虑情绪。如果浮肿持续不缓解或有加重趋势，应及时带患者到医院进一步评估，可能需要进行专业的淋巴水肿治疗等干预措施。",
