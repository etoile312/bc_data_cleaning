  "ai_answer": "对于胸部有肿块且有时疼痛的情况，首先考虑可能是乳腺相关疾病，建议尽快前往医院进行详细检查，比如乳腺超声、钼靶等检查以明确肿块性质，这处于术前评估阶段。如果确诊为乳腺癌等相关疾病，后续会根据具体病情进行相应治疗。对于发育不良情况，若为青春期女性，需保证营养均衡，可适当增加富含蛋白质、维生素等营养物质的摄入，保持健康的生活方式。对于经常头疼的情况，需要排查头疼是否与乳腺疾病相关，若与乳腺癌治疗等有关，需结合具体治疗方案来处理。在康复锻炼方面，若确诊乳腺癌后，根据治疗阶段进行适度的康复锻炼，比如术后早期可进行简单的上肢活动等；并发症处理需依据具体检查结果进行针对性处理；营养支持上要保证均衡饮食，摄入足够的营养以维持身体状况；心理疏导方面，要关注患者情绪，给予心理支持，可通过与患者沟通等方式缓解其焦虑等情绪，可参考相关癌症临床指南如CSCO等的建议来综合管理。但由于现有检索内容中针对这些具体问题的直接关联指导有限，建议及时咨询专业医师以获取更精准的个性化建议。",
