  "Q": "I have a lump under my breast, right where the underwire to my bra rests. it is fairly uncomfortable, and hard and seems fixed in place. I also wear an insulin pump and usually keep it in my bra, and it generally rests in the same place. Is is possible this lump might be from irritation from my pump, further exascerbated by the underwire?  Is this cause for immediate concern?",
  "A": "Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. You have hard lumped in breast.  It may be benign proliferative breast lesion like fibroadenoma, fibroadenomas or fibrotic disease.  Or it can be breast cancer.  You should go for examination, mammography and if needed go for biopsy of that lump. It will give you exact diagnosis. Then you should take treatment accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health."
