  "Q": "Hi Good Morning, I would like to enquire about a product called Bio Bust, I have a history of brast cancer in my family and i have Fimafibroses or Breast Mouse, i would like to know if a product such as this will put me at risk for breast cancer? and if it will influence ones Menstruation cycle? Kind Regards",
  "A": "Hello Alicia;welcome to Chat Doctor First there is no product which surely helps to enhance the breast as the breast is made of fatty tissues and mammary glands, so the increase will take place only after excess deposit of fat on the breast. As for the product to be used is will not make you more prone to breast cancer but if it does not benefit you there is no reason you should use it. The bio bust will only help to moisturize the breast skin. Thanks"
