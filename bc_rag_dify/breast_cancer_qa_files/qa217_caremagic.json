  "Q": "Hi, I have a lump under my right nipple and Im a boy 12 years old. It is abt 3 cm big and has lasted for a month. Its gotten bigger over time Ill say tripled. Its painless except for when pressure is applied. Its pretty far from the surface and Ive been slowing down alot, and having nausea.",
  "A": "Hi.it is best if you consult with a doctor, preferably a general or a pediatric surgeon, for medical and physical examination. Based from your description, it could be a cyst. Even if you're a boy, breast lesions could also occur. It could also be a fibrous or fibrotic lesion. These lesions are best evaluated clinically. Further diagnostic examinations, such as breast ultrasound, will be requested as needed. Management (medical and/or surgical) will be directed accordingly. Hope this helps. Good day!!~ Chat Doctor. "
