  "Q": "The last time I had my period was the 4th of May and today is July 8th and I still havent gotten it. Ever since Ive had a lot of clear discharge. Yesterday I had a little of pink blood mixed with watery clear discharge, I thought my period was starting but still nothing. Could I be pregnant?",
  "A": "Hello, and I hope I can help you today. The most common sign of pregnancy is a missed menstrual period. If you have been having unprotected sex, you are risk for pregnancy. Pregnancy symptoms vary widely between women, and symptoms of breast tenderness, vaginal discharge, mood changes, spotting, bloating and the like can be present both in pregnancy and in a premenstrual state. The best way to figure out if you are pregnant or not is to perform an over-the-counter urine pregnancy test. These tests are accurate to the same degree as a urine test performed in the doctor's office, and/or positive within three weeks of conception. So in summary, if you have been having unprotected intercourse, I recommend that you perform a urine test to rule out pregnancy. If you are not pregnant, and have missed your menstrual cycle for three months, it would be prudent to see a local GUN physician because hormonal imbalances and other causes may be the reason you have not menstruated for such a long time and the symptom should be evaluated. I hope that I've adequately answered your question today, and that this advice was helpful. Best wishes, "
