  "Q": "I am dealing with Stage IV breast cancer. I am receiving excellent care at the Holden Cancer Center at the U of I Hospital and Clinics in Iowa City, Iowa but am wondering if I could help myself more with additional natural products. I am taking turkey tail mushroom tablets that was prescribed by my Alternative M.D. that I see. Thanks",
  "A": "Cancer is uncontrolled growth of certain cells. Stage IV means that it has already spread to other distant parts and not much can be done anyway. All that can be done is to extend the duration and to keep it in control. Alternative therapies are not going to help, and I am sorry to inform that nothing else is going to help either. Just remain under the present treatment of the cancer hospital, and it will be as good as it can be."
