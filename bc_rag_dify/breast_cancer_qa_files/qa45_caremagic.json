  "Q": "hi l m mary jane romeroso, l m asking about the micro pills....before l use trust pills almost 4months. so l decide to change my pills which is micro pills...is it ok or safe and also what are those side effect of this pill....and also l don t want to weight gain...do we have pills that can prevent a loss weight.",
  "A": "Hi, Micropills contain only progesterone whereas combined pills contain both the female hormones, estrogen and progesterone. Micropills are used when estrogen is contraindicated due to their side effects. Irregular bleeding, breast tenderness, nausea, headache and mood swings are common with the Chat Doctor.  Weight gaining side effect may not be seen in all patients, and it is less common than other hormonal pills. Take care. Hope I have answered your question. Let me know if I can assist you further. "
