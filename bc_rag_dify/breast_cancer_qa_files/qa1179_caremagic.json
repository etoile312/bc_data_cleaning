  "Q": "Hi, I ve noticed this lump in my armpit and it s been there for at least a week already. It s not red, it s a large soft lump. U can see the difference between both armpits and there is a lump. It doesn t hurt, unless u press the spot maybe a fourth or half an inch in. Hasn t changed size at all during this time. Any idea of what it could be?",
  "A": "Hi! Good morning. I am Chat Doctor answering your query. It would have helped if you would have mentioned your age and sex. Although it might need a physical examination with related investigations like a mammogram followed by FNAC, from your history it looks to me like an accessory breast tissue being soft in consistency. The next possibility could be a lymph node due to any pathology in the lymph nodes itself or in the breast tissue. I would advise you to take an appointment with a general surgeon and get your self assessed by him for a definitive diagnosis and further management. I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem. Please do not hesitate to ask in case of any further doubts. Thanks for choosing Chat Doctor to clear doubts on your health problems. I wish you an early recovery. Chat Doctor."
