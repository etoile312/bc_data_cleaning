  "Q": "Hello,My aunt is 84 years old, is diabetic, has had a heart attack, stroke, and mastectomy. Last October a malignant tumor was found in her kidney and the kidney was removed. The procedure was to have been robotic, but the surgeon cut into vein and her kidney was removed surgically. My aunt almost died. Since then, she has continued to decline in strength, the incision never healed from inside and she has been going to a would center weekly for months now. Two weeks ago, she became very ill and was taken to the hospital where she was told she had a UTI. Unfortunately, it turns out she has MRSA, and an ulcer on her ankle that had been there for months and wouldnt heal. Her remaining kidney is not functioning and she has just been told she will have to go on lifetime dialysis. She is having difficultly breathing and is very weak. Can you offer an approximate prognosis based on this information. She has been through so much, and always with a wonderful attitude, but she is understandably very depressed and her family is very worried.Thank you.",
  "A": "Hello, As a urologist and transplant surgeon, I can understand your anxiety. Your aunts' survival through so many illnesses is itself gods miracle. Only he can prognosticate about her survival. But as you know, all our illness and recovery is according to Gods plan. As we age, our systems get weaker and survival is therefore decreasing. How long each system continues to function, no man on earth can say. If she survives for another year, till truly be another miracle. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further."
