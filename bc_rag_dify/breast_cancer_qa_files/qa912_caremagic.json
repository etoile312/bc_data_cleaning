  "A": "Hi, Thanks for writing in. Radiation is a form of energy and includes waves like gamma, beta and alpha. These waves have various energy levels and can penetrate to variable measures in to the body. They can reach the heart and cause effects due to radiation. The effects are not exactly the same in every patient. It can cause atrial fibrillation and differences in ECG due to radiation. There are nodes in the heart which are the center of heart rhythm activity. Radiation might affect the conduction in the heart and can cause alteration in conductivity leading to rare possibility of atrial fibrillation. Please be under observation of your cardiologist as most patients make a complete recovery. A medical fitness opinion is required and only if permitted, you proceed with the rest of the radiation treatment. Please do not worry."
