  "Q": "Please could someone advise me. It is now 11 weeks post chemo for breast cancer. My liver function tests AST is 84U/L  and ALT is 126U/L, they have climbed from AST 44 and ALT 60 taken 6weeks ago. I also have some mild discomfort in my liver area. Could this be due to the post chemo affect on my liver?  Susan",
  "A": "Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. You have history of breast cancer and taking chemotherapy. AST and ALT are liver enzymes and their levels are increased in liver damage. Your liver enzymes are slightly elevated, so mostly it is due to your chemotherapy. No need to big worry. Just repeat your liver function test after 15 days.  Hope I have answered your question, if you have any doubts then contact me at bit.ly/ Chat Doctor. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health."
