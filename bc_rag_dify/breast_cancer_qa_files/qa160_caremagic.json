  "Q": "i was diagnosed with DCIS this past january and my doctors said its cancer. after 5 months i went for pet/ct scan and no evidence of spreading out, i bumped it last month and i have this big hard lump about 2 to 3 centimeters, for 3 days was so painful but today theres no pain but it swollen and its like a bone that it hurting my skin.",
  "A": "Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. You have history of DCI. You have high chance of metastatic breast cancer.  Furthermore, you should go for true cut biopsy of that lump.  It will give you exact diagnosis whether it is metastatic carcinoma or some other mass.  Then you should take treatment according to diagnosis. Consult your doctor and plan accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health."
