  "A": "Hello, and I hope I can help you today. Theoretically, you can become pregnant even if you are one day late for your next Demo injection. However, it usually takes 3 to 6 months to resume your normal menstrual cycle. In the meantime, it is not unusual to have irregular hormonal symptoms like bloating, breast tenderness, mood changes, and spotting when you're not supposed to have your menstrual period, which can resemble the symptoms of pregnancy. So I recommend that you do an over-the-counter pregnancy test, just in case, and if it is negative, make sure that you use contraception in the future. I would suggest you see your gynecologist for an alternative method of birth control if necessary. I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. Best wishes and good luck,"
