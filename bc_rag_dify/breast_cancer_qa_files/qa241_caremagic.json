  "Q": "I believe I was bitten by a spider before Christmas. The nickel size wound did not ooze any fluid, my blood pressure at ER at first was 191 and went down to 167, it still remains high. I was bitten just below the nipple of my left breast. First, had swollen gland under my arm. The pain is very bad, the wound area it extremely painful. I have had mammogram and ultra sound tests that show nothing. But the pain radiates from the wound site through my left cheats area, down my left side and in my back. I don t know what else to do. Doctors just don t seem to worried, but I am. The pain is really bad, the wound is smaller but still there.",
  "A": "Hello, As per your history, it may be due to cardiac issues. For further assessment you may require ECG, 2 D Echo after consultation. Along with that you may require relevant blood investigations after consultation. For that kindly consult at urgent medical care for detailed medical examination. Meanwhile for pain you can take tablet acetaminophen. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.  "
