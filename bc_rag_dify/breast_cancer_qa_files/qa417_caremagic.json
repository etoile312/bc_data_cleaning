  "Q": "I was diagnosed this Thursday with Stage I uterine cancer (after a uterine biopsy). I have an appt scheduled with the cancer team at Bethesda Naval Hospital on Monday. On Tuesday of this week I was called in for spot mammography and breast sonogram sfter my annual mammogram came back suspicious for cancer in my left breast. The spot mammo and sonogram were rated BI-RADS 4 by the radiologist. The radiologist came in while I was still on the bed from the sonogram and told me I needed a biopsy. I am waiting for my consult for the biopsy on May 2nd. My question is IF I do have breast cancer, how are breast cancer and uterine cancer treated when they are present simultaneously? NOTE: I am 58 (59 on May 22nd) and post-menopausal since 2004. I had a D&C for fibroids in 2006, no problems since. My mother had bilateral masectomies at about age 60.",
  "A": "Both breast and uterine cancer will have to treated based on their respective stages. So, first we have to rule out any metastases from either of these tumors. For this you need to get an ultrasound abdomen, a chest x-ray and a bone scan. If both these tumors are localized and early then the treatment for both is surgery and both surgeries can be done at the same time. Further treatment will depend upon the biopsy report of the removed specimens."
