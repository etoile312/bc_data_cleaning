  "Q": "I am 61, Few years ago I had breast cancer , one breast removed went thru all chemotherapy , radiation etc Am on femara n heart pills, sugar reduction pills, have cholesterol and sugar levels fluctuate mostly on high side ! Sometimes feel nose blocks then when I blow my nose I see blood on my tissue It isn t much but noticed it on different occasions, My Question is how do I control sugar ? Getting blurry eyes can t even watch Tv as I can t see faces clearly Also want to drive my car as I feel happy when I drive",
  "A": "For control of sugars first thing to do is to go for regular exercise, diet control and medications. Medications prescribed by your doctor need to be strictly adhered to. If there is no control with oral medicines if your doctor things it is necessary. Then he will put you on insulin. Your blood pressure also needs to be checked regularly. High blood pressure is a common cause of nose bleed, but other local causes can be ruled out by an ENT specialist only. Your blurring of vision is also likely due to high sugars"
