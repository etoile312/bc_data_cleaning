  "Q": "I Had depo injection on 10/19/11. my LMP was on 10/07/11. Today is the 9th day after the injection. I would like to ask if its safe to have an intercourse now or shall I wait for another 5 days? Because some says it should be 2 weeks after the injection before you can have sex. Its my first time to use this depo thats why I want to be careful.And is it normal to have breast tenderness? Coz my original cycle will fall out this week if I didnt have the injection.",
  "A": "Thank you for the question, and thank you for visiting our site. Everything that you are describing is normal / expected.  Yes, you should use backup protection for at least a couple of weeks after initiation of the demo shot.  And yes, it is normal to have breast tenderness as well as a small amount of breakthrough bleeding over the next few months.  You will probably not get a normal cycle now that you have started this shot. I hope that this helps and good luck! "
