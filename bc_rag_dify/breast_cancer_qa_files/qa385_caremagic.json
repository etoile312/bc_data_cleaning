  "Q": "I have upper left quadrant pain in the abdomen. I previously was diagnosed with gastritis, however, this does not appear to be the same due to not having gas. This past January I was diagnosed also with ascites to the abdomen and had similar pain. I have metastatic breast cancer and currently the CT scans of chest and abdomen show pleural effusions both lungs only, no ascites (done two weeks ago). Any suggestions as to how to pursue this problem.",
  "A": "Hi. Thanks for your query. Sorry to know you are suffering from cancer breast with metastasis. Metastasis can classically present with ASCIIs and pleural effusion. I hope you are already under a care of an Oncologist and chemotherapy and/ or radiotherapy. This can explain the absence of ASCIIs now. You have to get tested for :Hologram to see hemoglobin, infection/ Anemia and hypoproteinemia can enhance your problems and have to corrected."
