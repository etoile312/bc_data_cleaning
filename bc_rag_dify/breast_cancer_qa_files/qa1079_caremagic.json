  "A": "Hello, Welcome Thanks for consulting Chat Doctor, I have gone through your query, as you have mentioned that you have fever after Extraction, it usually doesn't happened after extraction if you have fever then don't worry you can take medications for this. Take Analgesic, Antipyretic like Paracetamol 500Â mg twice daily for 3 days Do warm saline gargle two - three times a day after 24 hrs of extraction. If your fever continues then consult physician and go for complete mammogram. Hope this will help you.  Wishing you good health."
