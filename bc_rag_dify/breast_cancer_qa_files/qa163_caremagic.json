  "A": "Hi, Dear,Welcome with your query to Chat Doctor. Studied your query in full depth of its details. Reviewed it in context of your health concerns. Based On the facts, You would mostly need Sector Mastectomy to remove the recurring lumpy breast tissue, as the recent recurrence needs Excision Biopsy to work up on its malignant potentials. Prior Evaluation by Mammogram and USG / CT of the breast would help in planning extent of the diseased breast in your case. Other causes of such a complaint needs to be ruled out and treated if present accordingly from Second opinion from Surgeon. Hope that, This reply would help you to plan further treatment soon with your treating doctors. Best of Luck and early recovery. Welcome any further query in this regard, which would be replied in next session. Good Day!! Chat Doctor. N. Senior Surgical Specialist"
