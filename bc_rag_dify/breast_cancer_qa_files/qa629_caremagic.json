  "Q": "Its possible I could have gotten pregnant on January 8th and today I noticed my breast and nipples are sore. I woke up this morning with horrible pains like a pressure type pain as if I had to use the bathroom real bad down there around my bladder and my butt. Could that be a early pregnancy sign?",
  "A": "Soreness in the breast and nipple can be due to multiple causes like, Inflammation in breast tissue, breast cancer, hormonal imbalance, pregnancy, fibrocysctic breast changes, cervical radiculopathy, inflammation of the cartilage connecting breastbone and the ribs, inflammation of the superficial breast veins due to clot, any injury to breast. In your explanation you have doubt can it be due to pregnancy?. I suggest doing a pregnancy home test and check if its positive yes it can be due to pregnancy. But if its negative then I suggest meeting your gone doctor for proper check up and treatment. Now next is about your pressure pain in morning, it could be because of stomach upset or gastritis also. I suggest to check with doctor on this too if pregnancy test is negative. I suggest following above steps and do some changes in lifestyle like have good healthy different fruits and vegetables, do regular exercise and take proper sleep for better health. Take care."
