  "Q": "Hi there,for the last couple of weeks ive been having back ache/pain in  the middle of my upper back (between my shoulder blades) I went for a run and it was like I couldnt take a deep enough breathe in , i was really scared. Im 15 years old and I am female. I have a headache and woke up very dizzy and feeling quite sick but I havent thrown up.  Please help,",
  "A": "HIT hank for asking to ChatDoctorI can understand your problem, you went for run, and then you have this problem, it is common in female person having backache after the run because of the mammary glands, during the running time this moves randomly and tends to pull the back muscles unevenly, and this may cause great pain, before running you should have an advice from trained person for proper garment, now have muscle relaxant \"Chlorzoxazone\" with \"Diclofenac\" will give good result have nice day."
