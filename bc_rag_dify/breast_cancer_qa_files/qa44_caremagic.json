  "Q": "HI sir, iam a dentist aged 26/f , single, i found out 2 lumps in my neck rt side post auricular n cervical. i consulted an oncologist he advised for FNAC,blood smear study , mantoux test n routine blood test. the results were normal smear study, negative mantoux n reactive lymphadenitis, ESR-50 . My mom s a breast carcinoma patient . im under vaccination for cervical carcinoma two doses... do i have to worry? or wat further follow up should i do?",
  "A": "Hi, Nothing to worry right now. Reactive lymphadenitis is common finding. You should be on to follow up. You should search for any infective etiology at the Chat Doctor.  Exact size, shape, consistency, fixity to the underlying structures should be carefully examined. If the lymph node decrease in size no need of any investigation. Anyway, As you have family history of breast cancer it is better to go for clinical breast examination at three years interval. Take care."
