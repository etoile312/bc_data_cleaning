  "Q": "26 female Tri-Sprintect Tab I have been having pain in and under my left breast. It comes and goes, but has been present most of today. Also, I noticed a small lump in my left breast a few days ago. I dont know if the two are related. My period just ended today. I am not taking any other medications other than birth control. What is wrong?",
  "A": "Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern.  You have pain and lump in breast.  It can be due to fibroadenomas, fibroadenoma, other benign breast lesion or rarely breast cancer.  You should go for mammography and biopsy of that lump. It will give you exact diagnosis. Then you should take treatment according to diagnosis. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health."
