  "Q": "I have had pain in my left jaw joint for some time now, and I am unable to open my mouth all the way. I also feel pain whilst biting into solid food, like apples, and my teeth appear to have changed position slightly. This first occurred after a period of my jaw clicking, and moving out of place, meaning I would be unable to move it back, however it would usually right itself within a couple of days. One day, it stuck, and has been like this ever since. I am also going on a plane in a weeks time, and I am concerned as to the effect this may have.",
  "A": "Hi! Welcome to Chat Doctor. I read your query. Your symptoms correlate with TMJ disorder. This can be due to no. of reasons like jaw or teeth MAL alignment, oral muscles' problem, joint disc problem, clenching teeth, stress, etc. I suggest you to visit a dentist and get TMJ and teeth checked. Dentist may take x-rays or ask you to get MRI or CT of TMJ done. In case of joint or capsule disorder, corrective surgery can be planned if required. In addition, get teeth alignment correct if required. This can require braces, bands, crowns, etc. Get all fillings done. Use cold and warm compressions on joint and oral muscles. Ask your dentist for oral stretching exercises. Do them 3-4 times a day. Avoid opening of mouth too much. Use small and soft bite of foods. Avoid stress. Use bite plates to dissipate mastectomy forces on all areas of mouth. If you face any pain, ask your dentist for a prescription of painkillers or low dose anti depressants. Laser therapy is also helpful. Hope the answer helps. Thank you."
