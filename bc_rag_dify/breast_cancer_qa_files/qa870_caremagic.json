  "Q": "Have small lump under right breast doesn t hurt or move get pulsating sensation in breast and causes pain in my nipple when lifting breast up with hand looks kind of like an orange peel but when down doesn t look like that also have lump above collarbone was small and has gotten bigger was already on a 30 day antibiotic for boils under breast",
  "A": "Hello! Thank you for the query. Such lump can be a breast lump or benign skin lesion. As it is close to the breast, should be treated as possible breast cancer. That is why I suggest you to have proper diagnostics. Brest's ultrasound should be done and biopsy of this lump considered. If it has no contact with the breast, should be removed as a regular skin lesion. General surgeon should be able to do that. Hope this will help. Regards."
