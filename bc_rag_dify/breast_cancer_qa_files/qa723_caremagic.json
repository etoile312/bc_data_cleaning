  "Q": "Female 70years 220 lbs 5th 6. Have reddened area under left breast that has a center lump that is very sore when touched. Seemed to appear overnight. Soreness increasing in degree. Seems to have very small whiteheads. Is this possibly a boil? How should it be treated?  Have been applying A&D ointment.",
  "A": "Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. You may have some cyst, abscess, fibrotic disease of breast or breast cancer. Chances of cancer are very less likely. But you should go for fine needle aspiration cytology. It will give you exact diagnosis. Then you should take treatment accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have any doubts then contact me at bit.ly/ Chat Doctor. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health."
