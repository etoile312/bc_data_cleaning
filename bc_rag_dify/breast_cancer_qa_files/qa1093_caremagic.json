  "Q": "I am currently taking Tamoxifen, 20mg for L BREAST non-invasive cancer.  A TRAM procedure was done and it was recommended to take Tamoxifen for five years.  But I would like to have more children plus I had a tubal ligation six years ago.  If I am able to not be at risk of the cancer returning by stopping the tamoxifen, then a tubal-reversal would be a waste of time and I guess I should consider adoption? What do you think",
  "A": "Hello,Some cancers including breast cancer might show hormone-dependent behavior. It means that the amount of hormone circulating in the blood might decide the behavior of cancer. It is known that tamoxifen blocks the actions of estrogen and is used to treat and prevent some types of breast cancer. Therefore, if tamoxifen is stopped without recommendation, then there is unopposed action of hormones like estrogen which will then likely influence the recurrence of a cancer process. You might like to choose a surrogate mother for your child and complete your family and is a safe option than going for tubal reversal. Going in for adoption is a much safer method than to compromise on your health and take chances by stopping tamoxifen treatment. Please have a detailed discussion with your doctor. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.  "
