  "Q": "Hey. I m 19 years old and I took plan b about three weeks ago. I had mild side effects such as mood swings, muscle strains, headache and more. When I took it about 3 years ago I was suffering from numbness of the face, hands and feet.. Muscle pain, intense ear pain with tingling in my head. Anxiety and stomach upsetness. I noticed that as I get older the side effects become less and less. But i noticed something unusual about this time, even though i was getting my hopes up of not getting any serious side effects. I noticed that when i turn my head to a specific direction, there is a crunching noise in my right ear. And again, i m in perfect health never had any health problems but these stupid side effects that plan b causes. I m wondering if this is all in my head and if i should just wait till it goes away.. i mean it doesnt hurt or anything. I can live through it. also my chin and cheeks tend to get numb and tingly. Any suggestions? Is this normal? Do i really need to go to the doctors for this?",
  "A": "Hi, Thanks for the query. Plan B contains levonorgestrel. It can be used for emergency contraception. Usually emergency contraceptive pills present with symptoms like nausea, breast tenderness, bloating sensation etc. For more details : http://srsree.blogspot.in/2012/08/emergency-contraceptive-pill-short-term.htmlBut causing neurological problems is somewhat abnormal with contraceptive pills. They can cause headache, dizziness etc. But pain in ears, numbness etc. are not common side effects of emergency pills. So, if the symptoms persist, once consult ENT surgeon and get examined to rule out any ear pathology. If no abnormality is detected, the symptoms could be psychological and possibly subside soon. Better to avoid repeated intake of emergency pills. Take care."
