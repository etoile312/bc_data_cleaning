  "A": "Hello Thanks for posting at Chat Doctor. I have gone through your description. let's proceed one by one with your complaints.1) ESR 47 which is high. ESR levels are usually high when there is any inflammation or infection in the body. Total WBC counts are not mentioned. Can be rue to UTI.  Other reason can be H pylori infection Of stomach. 2) Triglycerides and LDL within normal ranges. No need to worry about them. 3) GGTP and GOT no need to worry. 4) H pylori infection can case gastritis and gastric ulcers. Should be started on antibiotics for H pylori and antacids. Since you mentioned that you don't eat properly, diet modifications should be done. Eat small quantities in short intervals for 5-6 times a day. Avoid oily, smoked, spicy, very hot food. 5) Blood in urine with UTI. Again should be on antibiotics. Some antibiotics can treat both UTI and h pylori. End ciprofloxacin, ampicillin. If despite antibiotics urine symptoms persist, do a urine culture. 6)Mammography findings being. Repeat scan every year. 7) Gall bladder stones not to be treated until they cause infection. 8) report suggest osteopenia. Please check it D levels and serum calcium. Continue supplements which you are taking.additional correction of vitamin D and calcium if found low. Since you were taking EPO I guess you have anemia and possible kidney disease. Please take iron supplements if hemoglobin is low. EPO once a week for hemoglobin less than 8 should also be considered. I hope I have solved all your queries. Wishing you good health. Regards"
