  "Q": "Hi, My mom had grade II breast cancer and every thing is completed including chemo and radiotherapy. Now she is having vitamin D deficiency. Doctor is recommending vit D injections. Is it okay to take those injections because i heard injections are painful and have side effects apart from its cost.Thank you",
  "A": "Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern.  She had breast cancer. She completed the treatment.  But if she has vitamin D deficiency then she should take vitamin D supplements.  Because low level can lead to weakened bone. So go for vitamin D level once and then take treatment accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health."
