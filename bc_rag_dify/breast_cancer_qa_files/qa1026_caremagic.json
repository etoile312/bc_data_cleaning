  "Q": "Hello, I am 24 years old, I had been diagnosed with CIN 1 in june of 2012, after a normal pap in 2011. Then upon repeat test i had CIN 2 in aug of 2012. my doctor did a lazer ablation of my cervix in dec and my last 2 paps have been normal. but in july of 2013 my periods have been getting very irregular, heavy, and longer. I saw my OB and she prescribed birth control. A few weeks ago i had sever pain in my left pelvic area and went to the er. upon ultrasound they found a left \"complicated hydropsalpix of 6.5cm with low level internal echoes and debris\"  rt ovary 4.1cm left 2cm.  and possible endometriosis. The doctor in charge of my care has left the practice and My new OB that took my case does not seem to be concerned at all. Do i need a second opinion?  I worry about cancer because my grandmother has had breast cancer twice, once at 35 and again at 64. 1 of her daughters (my aunt) has had ovarian cancer and another has had breast cancer. My father also has a sister with ovarian cancer. Given my family history, do i have a reason for concern? I am done having kids, i have 2, but when i asked my physician about the possiblily of a hysterectomy due to all the problems developing over the last year she said i was \"too young to make that choice\" Im just looking for another opinion. Thank you",
  "A": "Hi, Thanks for writing in. With history of IN 1 and family history of cancers, your concern and worry are genuine. At the same time you have been successfully treated for IN 1. At 24 years age it is too early to get hysterectomy done when your IN 1 has been treated. Ovaries are necessary for hormonal production in young women and should not be removed unless indicated. The complicated HY Chat Doctor.  You may take a second opinion on that concerning its management. Hope this helps"
