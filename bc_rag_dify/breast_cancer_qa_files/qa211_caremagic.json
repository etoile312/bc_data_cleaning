  "Q": "Hi. I am diagnosed with PCOS when I was 17. Now I am 28. For the past 10 years im just ignoring my pcos as im not really care about what it is. Just for the past a year, i started to do active research on it and seek for treatment as my menstrual cycle usually every 35 to 40 days. My gynae suggest YASMIN but in 1st cycle with it I encountered severe side effects such as bloated, stomach pain and breast tenderness. So i stop taking it. Last month i had my menses on 20/6/14 (bleeding) and ends exactly weeks after that. However on 2/7/14 i had back brownish kind of menses with clots till today (14/7/14). Is it something i should be worried about? And of course severe pain on right pelvic and back pain on and off. Am i having other problem than pcos such as endometriosis? Thanking you in advance. Regards. Aira",
  "A": "PCs and endometriosis management may have different procedures in modern science but in Ayurveda, treatment is 100% similar and effective in both the conditions. Try to get Pathway Swath liquid which is herbal decoction clearing endometrium on prolonged use. It clears cysts even by easing shedding out cysts also. Its pure herbal. No side effects. No interaction. May be used for six months also. Commonly available in India. Elsewhere, try to find it on net. It will help you 100%. I m 100% confident with my experience."
