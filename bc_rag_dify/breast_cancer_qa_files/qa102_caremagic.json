  "Q": "My Aunt is 76 had breast cancer 12 years ago and was diagnosed with secondaries in the spine 2 years ago and about 4 months ago was told it has spread to the liver. She is in a lot of pain and is not keeping much food or fluids down .... how long can this go on?",
  "A": "Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. She has breast cancer with liver and spine metastasis. It is stage 4 cancer. Surgery is not useful in this stage. So treatment options are chemotherapy and radiotherapy. But it will not cure the disease. It just works as palliative therapy. Despite all treatment prognosis remains poor. Life expectancy is not good. Sorry to say but it is fact. Consult your oncologist and plan accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have any doubts then contact me at bit.ly/ Chat Doctor. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health."
