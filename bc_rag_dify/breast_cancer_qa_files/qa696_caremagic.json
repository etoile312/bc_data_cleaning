  "Q": "Hi,My name is Kavitha and I am 28 now.A brief History before the problem.I was on femilon for 2 months- bad side effects, my GP prescribed Lutera28 then and since 5 months I am on it now. I have suddenly noticed a lunp on the right breast and it is painfull. I have had a fibroid removed some 8 yrs back i.e when I was 20 on the left breast...I have a twin who were born to me when I was 24, C- section, breast fed upto 1.3yrs of thier age.Could the lump just be a fibroid again or could it be something else??Is it because of Lutera??? I just do want to be under the knief again. regards, Kavitha.",
  "A": "Hi.it is best if you consult with a doctor, preferably a general surgeon, for physical examination. Yes, it might be a fibroid again or other benign breast lesions, but also, you need regular follow-up and monitoring for your breast concern. A breast ultrasound would be best for your concern. Further medical and/or surgical management will be directed accordingly. Hope this helps. Good day!!~ Chat Doctor. "
