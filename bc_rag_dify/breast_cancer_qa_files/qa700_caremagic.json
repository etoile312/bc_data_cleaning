  "A": "HAI.u have not mentioned the dosage, whatever 100 tabs is too much, do not give anything orally. Keep her will orally, take her to the emergency room as early as possible for an emergency stomach wash with cold saline,, checkout for vitals, bleeding tendency (gastrointestinal or rectal)mammogram, coagulation profile (pt, apt, INR))bleeding&clotting time.platelets.action of aspirin is normally for 7 days causing decreased platelets.transfusion of fresh whole blood, fresh frozen plasma, or platelets, infusion of pantoprazole, amino caproicacid will be of good help to stop the bleeding. This needs ICU observation and she needs a good psychiatric counselling"
