  "Q": "I went for a mamogram and they found something in each breast. they siad they want to me to come back in 6 months. But when I went back in to see the OBGYN she was concerned that it is stage 4 she siad. I thought that stages were only for breast cancer and not for the look of the results of the mamogram. I am confused. I go back for the other mamogram in 11 weeks. should I be more concerned if my OBGYN is concerned.",
  "A": "Hello, welcome to Chat Doctor. It appears that you don't have breast cancer because if your mammogram show some abnormality suggestive of cancer, you need to do biopsy and receive surgery/radiotherapy /chemotherapy not follow up. Most probably they were talking about BIRDS classification No 4. BIRDS is breast imaging reporting and data system, and was established by the American College of Radiology. BIRDS is used to classify mammogram finding into numerical category. The BI-RADS assessment categories are: 0- incomplete, 1- negative, 2-benign findings, 3-probably benign, 4-suspicious abnormality, 5-highly suspicious of malignancy, 6-known biopsy with proven malignancy. Since you had BIRDS 4 lesion, you are asked to follow up with mammogram again. Nothing to worry. Regards"
