  "Q": "Hello.... I recently discovered a large mass in my right breast. It seems warm and my breast is swollen, much larger than the other. It is tender as well. Also, I have been dealing with what was thought to be an under the skin abcess for two months. It is quite painful and hasn t responded to antibiotics. My doctor told me it would eventually come to a head but it has not. The skin above it looks like a bruise. I have been waking every morning to pain in my rib area all around. It is sore to the point that it wakes me and forces me to get up so the pain will decrease. I also have been coughing up alot of thick mucus without any other symptoms of an upper respiratory infection. I am asthmatic, so those usually hit me hard. I m afraid these could all be signs of breast cancer. I made an appointment for tomorrow, but was hoping to get an idea of these signs before I go. Thank you.",
  "A": "Hi.based from your description, it could be any of the breast tumors. It could be a cyst, a fibrous (fibrous tissue formation) or fibrotic changes of the breast, which are all benign breast lesions. Malignancy must also be ruled-out. It is best if you consult with a doctor, preferably a general surgeon, for clinical evaluation. Diagnostics such as breast ultrasound and mammography may be recommended. Management (medical and/or surgical) will be directed accordingly. Hope this helps. Good day!!~ Chat Doctor. "
