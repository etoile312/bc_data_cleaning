  "Q": "My mom was admitted into the hospital tonight with a baseball size infection in her left arm by her armpit. She had breast cancer 2 years ago and a left myscetomy of the breast, also had about 27 lymph . Nodes removed from the same arm. Hospital said this infection is so bad it is life threatening, and could be an abcess... what is your opion?",
  "A": "Hi, Thanks for the query. Infection is invariably very common in cancer because of decrease in immunity. Lymph nodes could be due to infection or metastasis. This can be confirmed by investigations, antibiotics need to be given on the basis of microbiological studies. Your Physician will look into all these and prescribe appropriate antibiotics. These infections are treatable and hence not life-threatening. Kindly take the opinion of treating doctor and give proper medication. The surrounding area of infection needs to be cleaned using either Spirit or Detail/HY Chat Doctor.  Thanks"
