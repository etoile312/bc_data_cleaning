  "Q": "IDC Breast cancer 3 years ago..treated with usual high doses of chemotherapy, 32 radiation treatments, one year of herceptin. Had 2 bone marrow biopsies be.cause suffering from pancytopenia. Bone marrows negative. Doc says I have low risk MDS. Had 2 pints of blood and one pint of platelets last week...critically low. Have been taking Papaya for close to a year now....no help: (",
  "A": "Hi, dear. I have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. You have chemotherapy and radiotherapy That leads to pancytopenia.  It can also lead to MDS. So you are given external support with RBC and platelets.  You should take maintenance therapy till you recover.  If you developed full-blown MDS then stem cell transplantation can be helpful. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health."
