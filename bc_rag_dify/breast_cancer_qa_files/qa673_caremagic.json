  "Q": "Hi i am 24 I had a wreck when I was 19 an I tore my kidney wall, I have had leakage out of my belly button since then but it has jus now recently become really bad I hurt in my stomach an back an My stomach has gotten bigger an feels full of fluid I also have lumps that have come up on my breast an I have horrible migraines. What do you think it is?",
  "A": "Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. You have lump in your breast.  Your kidney disease and stomach problems has no relation with your breast lump. Your breast lump can be due to fibroadenoma, fibrotic disease, fibroadenomas or rarely breast cancer.  Chances of cancer is very rare at your age.  You have benign breast disease most likely.  You should go for fine needle aspiration cytology and mammography of that lump.  It will give you exact diagnosis. Then you should take treatment accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health."
