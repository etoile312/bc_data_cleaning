  "Q": "Hi. I have been diagnosed with fibroids that measures 11cm x 8cm x 7.6cm and contains multiple submucosal, intramural and subserosal uterine fibroids. The largest is anterior and measures 3.6cm x 3.2cm x 3cm. I am trying to get pregnant. Does this decrease my chances? How serious is this",
  "A": "Hi, It would have been great if you had mentioned the locations of fibroid in the uterine cavity, because fibroid near the Fallopian tubes can cause their blockade and thus may cause infertility while those near the cervix can cause blockade and thus impeding the sperms to enter the uterine cavity and can cause a complicated labor once pregnant. Overall the chances of infertility with fibroid are nearly 3%.  The most common cause is failure of implantation of embryo to the uterine wall in the submucosal fibroid. You have multiple fibroid and want to conceive, the best advice for you would be to undergo \"mastectomy\". Regards and wishing a happy family."
