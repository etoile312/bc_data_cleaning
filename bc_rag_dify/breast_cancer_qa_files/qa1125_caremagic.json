  "Q": "Right now I am schedual to start chemotherapy for breast cancer my oncology and radiation doctors seems to think I need a second surgery when my surgeon took out the lympnos he took out 8 and out of those 8 six had cancer the surgeon do not want to do a second surgery now I dont know if I should get a second opinion or not.",
  "A": "Hi, Thanks for writing in. Surgery is the treatment recommended when cancer is in early stages. Since your surgeon had found 6 out of 8 lymph nodes having signs of cancer therefore it is important to do more exploration and clear up the disease. Chemotherapy and radiation are also required, but surgery is important to reduce the bulk of cancer. Though it might sound difficult for you at the moment however doing a second surgery will be able to reduce disease and help you achieve a better response to chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Early treatment is the key to survival in cancer. Please do not worry."
