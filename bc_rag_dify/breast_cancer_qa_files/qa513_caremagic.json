  "Q": "I have just been diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma of the left breast. It is stage 2. The doctor thinks the grade is 1 or maybe 2. I have been offered a choice of lumpectomy or mastectomy. I am a divorced women, age 61. I also have autoimmune hepatitus overlap syndrome and PBC. I have been on liver medications since 2008.  Would my liver disease affect my choice of cancer procedures? I also am taking thyroxin for an underactive thyroid. I have been on disability since 2008.",
  "A": "Hello and welcome to Chat Doctor, An invasive breast cancer is managed by surgery-mastectomy. Lumpectomy can result in recurrence of the lesion later. If the breast lump is associated with involvement of lymph nodes, chemotherapy is also needed. The presence of autoimmune hepatitis, intake of thyroxine or liver medication will not interfere with the type of surgery. Lumpectomy is not done now-a-days because of chance of recurrence. You need to consult your surgeon for further management. Thanks and take care Chat Doctor. "
