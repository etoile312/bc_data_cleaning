  "Q": "I am 78 asian male with bilateral nipple soreness of few weeks. What could be causing it? I have no palpable breast masses.  History positive for high BP (controlled by Benicar), I had mitral valves replaced (2005) and I have a St. Jude pacemaker. I take Crestor, Benicar, Toprol XL, ASA (81 mg) and supplement pills.",
  "A": "Hi, thanks for sharing your health concerns with Chat Doctor!  If I were your treating Doctor for this case of PAINFUL nipples, I would like to know if any discharge per nipples on squeezing: However, as per your description, I would come up with only one and one possibility and that is GYNECOMASTIA! I think this is related to your chronic medication...and take ice/cold compress for temporary relief! I suggest you to go for an FNAC and USG of the regions for confirmation and to relieve your concerns! Hope this answers your question. If you have additional questions or follow-up questions then please do not hesitate in writing to us. I will be happy to answer your questions. Wishing you good health."
