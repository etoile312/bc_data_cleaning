  "A": "Hello, Thanks for posting your query on Chat Doctor ...* Brief Answer: breast implants have nothing to do with your cardiac management.*Explanation: My opinion is that in your condition, You seem to be in a stable state, from cardiology point of view, if you are on an medication, anti failure, etc. you should stick on them. Any future surgeries you should inform your physician about your cardiac condition and he or she will assess your case. I suggest my patients the following: breast implants do not affect your cardiac condition, but you should inform the anesthesiologist about last cardiac medications and investigation. The information provided by you is not sufficient to provide a good opinion. If someone comes to me with this condition I would ask them about the medication you are on and other comorbidities like diabetes, hypertension, etc.*Conclusion: I suggest you shouldn't be worried about breast implant, nothing to do with your heart.  If you have any further questions I will be happy to help, If not, you can close the discussion and rate the answer. Wish you good health."
