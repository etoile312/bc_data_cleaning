  "Q": "I am scheduled to have a breast core biopsy done this Friday for a 6mm nodule found on ultrasound, I have had bloody discharge twice in a period of 1 year. The Ultrasound is characterizing it at BIRAD 4 twice in a 6 month period , I have breast pain as if the breast had broken glass in it. Only breast cancer in family was in my aunt. What are the concerns I should have,,,the obvious is of coarse cancer",
  "A": "Bloody discharge from the nipple along with a lump on ultrasound and a family history of breast cancer are all ominous signs for you having cancer in the breast. BIRDS 4 means that the chances of the lump having cancer are in the vicinity of 60-70% and the least you need to do is get a biopsy. Problem is that to do a core needle biopsy from a 6Â mm lump is technically difficult. If the biopsy is done successfully and returns a diagnosis, then it is alright, but if it misses the lump (in which case the biopsy report will show only normal breast tissue), I would suggest you get operated to remove the lump and send the entire lump for diagnosis. That has a dual benefit. Once it will give a conclusive diagnosis and two, it will remove the chances of this lump developing cancer later on. Even if it turns out to be cancer in the biopsy, it is at a very early stage and you shouldn't worry as you will completely get cured with proper treatment."
