  "A": "Hi, Postinor-2 is an effective form of emergency contraception. Its common side effects include vomiting, headache, breast pain and bloating. You should use positnor-2 only in emergencies and not as a regular method of contraception. If it is used more than once in a menstrual cycle it is more likely to upset your menstrual cycle causing irregular or heavy bleeding. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Take care "
