  "A": "Hi, Dear,Good Morning. Thanks for the query to my Chat Doctor Clinic. I studied your query in depth. I am concerned about the worries you have. In my opinion, you have mostly-Vaginal pimples prior to periods. Its as common as facial pimples with periods. Consult ER-Gynaec- Doctor-who would treat as follows-a-Tb-NSAIDs, ICE-Compresses and REST-for a 1wk. If relived ok. This is the remedy for your lump. Hope with this you would be relieved of your worrisome query. Wellcome again to Chat Doctor. Have a good Day."
