  "A": "Hi, thanks for using Chat Doctor In general, it is thought that ovulation occurs about 10 to 17 days after the onset of the last period. If the periods are irregular, it is more difficult to pinpoint the exact time. In most women ovulation would not have occurred by day 8 but having said that, it is possible to get pregnant at any time in the cycle, the chances are just greater at different times. White curry discharge is usually a sign of a yeast infection which can easily be treated, yeast infections can occur in the absence of pregnancy. Signs and symptoms in early pregnancy include: fatigue, nausea and vomiting, dizziness, breast tenderness. If you are unsure, you can consider doing a home pregnancy tests, which are usually accurate. You can choose one of the early detection kits which can detect lower levels of the hormone Chat Doctor, which is the hormone found in the urine during pregnancy. I hope this helps"
