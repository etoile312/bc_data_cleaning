  "Q": "Hi, I ve had a lump, pea size in my armpit for over 3 months now. Sometimes I do get aching in both armpits.I am in my mid 60s, 5 4, 125 pounds. Mammogram was normal, ultrasound results said it was a varicose vein type lesion and there was a lymph node as well. Recommended waiting 3 months and repeating ultrasound. Do you think this should be investigated further now, or, is the 3 month period safe to wait?Thanks,",
