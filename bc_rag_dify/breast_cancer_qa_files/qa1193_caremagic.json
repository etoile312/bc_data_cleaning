  "Q": "I have a lump in my right breast about an inch under my nipple. I noticed it two weeks ago and it has not changed in shape since then. The lump is not painful and the skin on my breast above the lump is red and the skin is peeling. I m really worried. I am 33 years old and have breast fed three children (stopped a year ago with my youngest.)",
  "A": "Hi, thanks for your query to my virtual Clinic at Chat Doctor. You seem to suffer from ? Abscess in breast cyst? Intro ductal Cystic Adenoid of breast, with ? Fibocystic disease. I would suggest you to consult Er Surgeon for Second Opinion as other causes of such breast lumps need to be ruled out by first-hand check-ups from doctor. Treatment -I would advise USG guided FNAC biopsy of the lump with planned surgical excision thereafter, by Er Surgeon under antibiotic and ANI- inflammatory Chat Doctor. Hope this reply satisfies you.Don't forget to hit thanks and write excellent review comments to help needy visitors at Chat Doctor. Wishing fast recovery to you."
