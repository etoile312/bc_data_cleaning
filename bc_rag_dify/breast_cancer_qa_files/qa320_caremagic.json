  "Q": "I am female aged 41, 1.70m tall and weight 96Kg. I have breast cancer and have just finished chemotherapy. I was given 3 x 3wk cycles of docetaxal and a trial drug called artemis and then 3 x 3wk cycles of FEC, with one of those weeks with the artemis trial drug. I am due to have a lumpectomy in a couple of weeks, which I should have had earlier this month, but a CT scan showed that I developed a blood clot in my right lung during chemotherapy. I am on the blood thinner enoxaparin sodium. Earlier this week, I noticed a lump on my head which was not there before, and I have also been getting headaches. The lump is not sensitive to touch although the top of my head has been tender since I lost all of my hair around the 5 cycle, which is now growing back. Is this something that I should go back to my cancer health care nurse/oncologist about or is it just a lump with normal headaches given what I have been through recently?",
  "A": "Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern.  You have breast cancer with lump on head. It can be Desmond cyst, skin adnexal tumor or lipoma.  However, possibility of metastatic carcinoma from breast is also there.  So you should go for fine needle aspiration cytology or biopsy of that lump first.  It will give you exact diagnosis. Then you should take treatment accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health."
