  "Q": "my mother who is 79 years old is suffering from Acute Renal Failure, she has seen Doctors but no on seems to be doing anything about it. should we be doing something different? She is c/o feeling weak, tired no energy, no appetite, vomiting, nausea and she continues to loose weight.",
  "A": "Hi, I want to know on what basis your mother is labeled as having Acute renal failure (ARF). I want to know her reports mainly serum urea, creatinine, electrolytes, mammogram, urine examination, ultrasonography of urinary system, blood gas investigation, urinary protein loss if done. I also want to know her daily urine out put, her past medical history like presence of high BP problems, diabetes, cholesterol problem, medications if she is on, recent consumption of medicines like painkillers, her habits like smoking. What was the cause given for ARF? Whether there is need for hemodialysis? In case of Acute renal failure most of the time there is underlying cause like infection of kidneys, severe deny Chat Doctor. In most of cases treatment of underlying cause suffice, once underlying cause is corrected ARF start resolving. But in severe cases there might be need for dialysis which depends on serum urea, creatinine, electrolytes levels, blood gas investigation, urine output per hour. There may require long duration to resolve ARF i.e. to decrease serum creatinine levels, sometime even progression to chronic renal failure. What ever the symptoms mentioned by you like feeling weak, tired no energy, no appetite, vomiting, nausea, and she continues to lose weight all indicate persistent ARF or progression to chronic renal failure. In case of renal failure certain important points are-1) Adequate nutrition, protein intake.2) Avoid use 0f nephrotoxic medicines like painkillers.3) Keep BP, sugar level, cholesterol in control.4) Watch for daily urine output."
