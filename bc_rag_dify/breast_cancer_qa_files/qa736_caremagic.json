  "Q": "Thank you. I have had a cough for 4 and 1/2 years. I have been to several doctors and had several test done. They checked my Thyroid, put a tube down my nose for 24 hours and monitored when I ate, drank, and was at rest. One doctor said that I needed to have surgery on my esophagus and then another doctor tells me that it is the cancer med that I take for my breast cancer that I need to take for 1 and 1/2 years more. Another doctor said it is allergies and puts me on shots and pills. I does not help. I cough so hard I through up, and I sometimes feel like I am going to pass out. They have done chest x-rays, blood work, and ultra sound on my thyroid and they did not find any thing yet. Is there any thing that I can do or any test that I can ask the doctors to run on me.",
  "A": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. In my opinion you should consult pulmonologist and get done PFT (Pulmonary Function Test) to rule out bronchitis. As untreated bronchitis can cause chronic cough (Chat Doctor. Breast cancer patient after chemotherapy and radiotherapy can develop bronchitis. So possibility of radiation induced bronchitis is more in your case. You may need inhaled bronchodilators and oral antihistamine "
