  "Q": "I had breast cancer in 2003. I have been cancer free for 10 years. after my cancer my white blood cell count became extremely low and I have been taking IVIG treatments for 8 years. Until 3 months ago it was at a good level but then I started having all kinds of infections an my Dr. increased my dosage of my IVIG meds. and instead of every 28 days  moved me to every 21  days. I had some labs run the last wk. and was told that my white cells had dropped to a chronic low and I would probably have to have a bone marrow biospy within the next 6 months. The nurse said she was sorry to have to give me such bad news. I dont understand exactly what is happening. Can you help me to understand?",
  "A": "HIT hank for asking to ChatDoctorI can understand your concern, the low WBC counts indicates so many etiologies from infection to hematological condition and that need to be differentiated from each other the first step would be hematology test, and the bone marrow is the only way for this to find out the exact cause, let us hope for the good you can ask any further question without hesitation have great day."
