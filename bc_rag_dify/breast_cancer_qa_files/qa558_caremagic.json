  "Q": "My sister had breast cancer it was 1 degree so the doctors decided to take her breast they sad that is the safest . They took her breast  then she started the chemotherapy after that she did all the tests she has to do and shes taking hormones now but the problem now and because shes overseas its hard to do the radiotherapy they sd to her you have to do 1 month after the chemotherapy but she couldnt find any nearest appointment the gave her till May which is 6 month is it too late to do or not.R",
  "A": "Thanks for query. After mastectomy chemotherapy is to kill small metals which is spread and not detectable by routine scan. Radiotherapy is to burn cancer tissue around the resected area where chemotherapy does not reach as vessels are either ligated or cauterized during surgery. Basically this is the theme of treatment. So it is better to take radiotherapy .now it's all available even in small towns .It's never late.regards"
