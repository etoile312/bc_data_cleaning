  "Q": "im 22 married 3 yrs back....my gynac gave me ovacare for three months coz im now in abroad with my husband....two months have gone starting taking ovacare.....my due date was 5thjune but slight blood seen on 29th may....after that slight brown fluid is seen since 5 days.....what to do",
  "A": "Hi, Ovacare contains essential micronutrients commonly prescribed to help in increasing the pregnancy rate by improving the ovarian function. Generally it is well tolerated however it may cause dyspepsia, breast tenderness, irregular periods and loose motions. Based on the history you seem to have implantation bleeding suggestive of an early pregnancy. This bleeding stops on its own and doesn't require treatment. Get a home urine pregnancy test done and consult your doctor. Hope I have answered your question. Let me know if I can assist you further. "
