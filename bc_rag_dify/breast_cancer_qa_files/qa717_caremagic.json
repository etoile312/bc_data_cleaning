  "Q": "I had a crown put in on my upper left side in Oct/Nov. In late Nov, early Dec I noticed I developed a lisp. My dentist couldnt help. I have ringing in the left ear and now my left jaw bone by my ear is protruding. I was on a steroid to get the swelling down but the jaw is still out and I still have a lisp. Any suggestions.",
  "A": "Dear friend, than for sharing your concern, prosthetic crown is placed on tooth for two reasons. One is to help chew, bear the mastectomy load, also transmitting the same to the supporting alveolar bone effectively. Next, it is esthetically valuable. But be sure that this will not cause any referral pain to ear or neck etc. if this happens there must be some pathology associated with the concerned tooth.  sometimes if the crown is not placed properly it causes discomfort too. You have to visit your dentist and get it reexamined. You have not mentioned, since how long you have been on steroids and for what ? The lisp you mentioned can also be due to faulty crown placement, for this occlusion correction has to be done, or sometimes the whole crown has to be replaced again. I suggest you to see your dentist soon. Hope it helps than"
