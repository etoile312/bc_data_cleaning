Isnt there a blood test to tell if you have cancer? I am diabetic",
  "A": "Hi, It is very important to detect cancer early when it is still curable. However, none of the tests you have mentioned is for cancer. Unfortunately, the answer to your cancer is not that simple. Cancer is a disease that can be presented in various types and can arise in any body part. Depending upon the type of cancer, there are different tests available for early detection, however, there is no one test, that can detect all types of cancer with certainty. For example, for breast cancer - tests like mammography (special types of x-rays of breasts) can help in detection. For Lung cancer - tests like CT scan can help. For Prostate cancer - blood test like PSA can give clues. For head and neck cancer - a simple examination by a doctor can help in detection. Thus, for every cancer, we have a different test for its detection. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. "
