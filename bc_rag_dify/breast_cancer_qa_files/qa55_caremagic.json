  "A": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your sisters situation and problem. Morphine can cause sedation, but it can not cause profound sedation. Profound sedation in Patient with metastatic breast cancer can be due to many causes, but the common causes are 1. Brain metastasis 2. Electrolyte disturbance like hyponatremia. So better to first get done MRI brain to rule out brain metastasis and electrolyte levels to rule out electrolyte disturbance. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wishing good health to your sister. Thanks."
