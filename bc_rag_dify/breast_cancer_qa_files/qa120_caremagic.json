  "Q": "I am 53 year old and a year ago I was diagnosed with duct carcinoma breast cancer, went through surgery and radiation and was on tomoxifen and now they put me on femara due to the fact that I had a hysterectomy in May 2011.  Besides taking vitamins and calcium these are the only medicine but when I go to sleep I fall asleep fast and then about an hour or two I jump out of bed and feel like something is wrong.  I usually walk to the bathroom and then go back to bed and usually I fall asleep right a way or within a few minutes.  Sometimes I sleep the rest of the night but sometime it comes back again within a few hours. What should I do.   I",
  "A": "The treatment that you have undertaken appears to be scientifically correct, and you need not worry about it. Also, none of the Chat Doctor.  It is probably a result of insomnia due to the stress of the disease and the treatment that has its toll on the mind. It is best you take a sedative at bedtime for a few weeks. Meanwhile, try to occupy your mind with activities during the day. Join a meditation group. Don't sleep during the day. Eat at least 1 hour before bedtime."
