  "A": "Hi, You are 22/F, HT. 5.9. WT. 55 Kg. - you are suffering from Multiple Fire Adenoid of left breast for 2 yrs. One of the fibroadenoma which was 2 cm in size recently increased to 3.2 cm. You are less than 25 yrs (important age to bother), immediate Mammogram, Scan, FNAC to be done. If every thing reports as non-cancerous - without wasting time - without bothering disfigurement and ductal damage total excision all the fibroadenomas and once again wait for HPE report especially from the recently increased size. If every thing is normal don't bother - when it is excised in total recurrence is rare. But a close observation is needed for the development of new fibroadenoma. If HPE reports are not normal, treat accordingly. Best wishes"
