  "Q": "Hi Im 19 and I have a pimple-like thing on my areola. It was a bit bigger earlier, and now it became small. But another pimple looks like coming out. I searched on google what might cause it, it says that it has something to do with the Montgomery gland (pls correct me if Im wrong). But I was also thinking if it could be chickenpox since I had contact with a little guy with chickenpox. Please tell me what I can do as a first aid. Is this a breast cancer symptom or whatever?",
  "A": "Hi and welcome to Chat Doctor. Thank you for your query. Chickenpox usually starts in face, and you would already have such pimples all around. This can be simple bacterial skin infection or gland infection, this is called Montgomery glands and can commonly be inflammation. This is nothing serious and it can't be cancer. It usually passes spontaneously but sometimes if this persists and progresses you might need topical steroids for it so consult your GP. Wish you good health."
