  "A": "Hi, dear. I have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. You may have leiomyoma.  It is the benign tumor of smooth muscle.  Uterus is the most common site for it. You should go for mastectomy or hysterectomy according to your gynecologist advice.  Don't worries its totally curable. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health."
