  "Q": "I had my last mensuration on 28 feb and generally next mensuration comes before 5 days. Since 28 feb we are not using any precaution during sex. From last week i have started taking pregnanacy test, as i eagrly want to know about it. I had my last test on 19th evening and 20 th morning. On 19th it was showing negative. And on 20th morning its showing invalid. I have taken 2 test few daz before also, one in evening and other in moring. And same thing happened. I am not able to make out the final result. Please guide me in this regard. Why it is happening so ?",
  "A": "Hi there, My opinion after reading your question is:1) A home urine pregnancy test comes positive only 2 to 3 days after a missed period at its earliest.2) If you want to know sooner, you can get a blood test called serum beta Chat Doctor which can give positive results by 3-4 weeks.3) Watch out for symptoms of pregnancy like vomiting, nausea, breast tenderness etc., but they are not reliable signs of pregnancy.4) My suggestion is that you wait till at least till 1st and then get a urine pregnancy test. Till then, just sit back and relax and let nature take its course. If you are really anxious, you can take the blood test mentioned above right now. I wish you all the very best for your pregnancy."
