  "Q": "I am a 23 year old male PT grad student, sorta poor diet, 511 160lbs. I recently discovered a pimple-like ordeal bump under i my gooch area. I had popped it and then as days passed by it has just gotten bigger. It is now the size of a walnut. My father died of cancer and my mother is a breast cancer survivor. For the past few years one of my testicles( smaller than the other, but not by much) has become noticeably more sensitive as well. I have seen a doctor about the testicle pain but he had told me previously that it is nothing to worry about. However this pimple like infection is new (4 days) and has just gotten bigger and i have noticed not only more swelling but another one is coming up. I do not shave so I do not believe that it is an ingrown hair infection.",
  "A": "Hi and welcome to Chat Doctor. Thank you for your query. It doesn't need to be ingrown hair, but it can be bacterial skin infection with no obvious cause. If you are afraid of cancerous you shouldn't be, it doesn't manifest on this way. You should just not to rough it scratch it and apply some antibacterial cream. If this grows you might need antibiotic treatment so consult your GP about it. Wish you good health."
