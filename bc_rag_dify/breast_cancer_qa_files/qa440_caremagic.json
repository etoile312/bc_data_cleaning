  "A": "Hello, There is no single treatment option for follicular cystitis. An effective course of treatment for one patient may not work for another. Antibiotics are prescribed if infection accompanies inflammation of the bladder.  Chat Doctor.  These may include bladder coatings, antidepressants, and antihistamines. Antispasmodics and bladder anesthetics may also be used. Surgical options, such as bladder augmentation or mastectomy, are sometimes considered, but only as a last resort after all other options have been exhausted. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further."
