  "A": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. Your father is ideal candidate for CABG (Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting). Any patient with triple vessel disease should go for CABG. So you must get done CABG. In this procedure the blocked arteries are bypassed by veins or arteries. Veins used are anterior tibial vein, popliteal vein. And the best is internal mammary artery. It is now considered as less risky procedure as more and more expertise has been achieved.  So you should not worry much. And PGI is good institute. So get done there. The cost will be around 1.5 to 2 lakhs."
