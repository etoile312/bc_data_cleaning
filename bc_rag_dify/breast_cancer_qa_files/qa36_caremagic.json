  "Q": "Hi, Im 25 years old and have had cancer twice. I want to use propecia to help prevent more hair loss but the sight of seeing prostate cancer and breat cancer as two of the side effects that scare me. What, in your mind, is a ballpark percentage of me being diagnosed with prostate cance and/or breast cancer if I start taking procecia?",
  "A": "Hi, Thanks for writing in. Propecia is a 5-alpha reductase inhibitors group of medicine and contains finasteride which helps in hair growth. Treatment with finasteride reduces the risk of being diagnosed with low-grade prostate cancer. But there is an increased risk of a later diagnosis of high-grade prostate cancer. Please discuss with your doctor on the probabilities of alopecia intake causing a higher incidence of high grade prostate cancer in later life. At 25 years age you might not have any side effect but with continued intake the risk rises. Instead of taking alopecia you can apply lotion containing a combination of minoxidil and finasteride which works for hair growth. Please do not worry."
