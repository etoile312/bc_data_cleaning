  "Q": "I am a female age 38, went for first mammo and they performed an ultrasound and found a lobulated mass on right breast, hypovascular in color doppler but equivocal on strain elastography. and recommended a biopsy. US BIRADS 4, suspicious... all this big words are driving me nuts. What is birads, what does hypovascular means.... does it sounds bad :( worried",
  "A": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your situation and problem. US BIRD is the scoring system for breast mass. It depends on characteristics on mammography. It is having 4 categories. Category 1 considered as benign growth and hence no follow up or biopsy is required. Category 4 considered as malignant suspicious growth and hence biopsy is required. Biopsy provide tissue for histopathological examination. And histopathology is the confirmatory test for the diagnosis of malignancy. Your breast lump is loculated and hypovascular, these also favor possibility of malignancy more. So first get done biopsy and then decide further treatment."
