  "Q": "hellomy wife was told that her ultrasound showed an unremarkable cyst or growth and her doctor said that it was small. She has been experiencing back pain at the end of her period, other than that she has no other symptoms. She had 2 CA125 tests that showed her protein to be high. Can this be due to cancer or are there other reasons for these results?",
  "A": "Hi, Ovarian cyst is a common phenomenon. Ultrasound can reliably differentiate between a benign ovarian cyst with some other suspicious ovarian tumors. CA-125 very often increased in many non-malignant causes. Mastectomy may be an option in treatment of ovarian cyst, but that can be decided by your gynecologist. If any suspicious lesion is found on imaging more radical surgery should be done and pathology report should be obtained. Consult your gynecologist."
