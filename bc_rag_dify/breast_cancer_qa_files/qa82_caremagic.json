  "Q": "Hi- I went for a mammogram and an ultra sound today because I found a large hard lump in my right breast on Monday. They did the mammogram and ultrasound and then decided to do a biopsy today. The lump found was 4.5cm and was described as a rubber golf ball. They had a very difficult time getting the biopsy because the lump was so hard and they couldn t get into it. I am very worried that this is cancerous and I am worried about how long I have had it since it is so large. Any input would be appreciated.",
  "A": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. There are many causes for lump in the breast. But the description you provided points towards either fibroadenoma or malignancy. Hardness you described seen most commonly in malignancy.  But biopsy is the gold standard for diagnosis of breast lump. And no need to worry much even if this turns out to be malignant, as breast cancer treatment is very effective and life expectancy is very high. Newer surgical techniques and improved chemotherapy and radiotherapy make breast cancer a treatable cancer. So no need to worry much. Just get done biopsy."
