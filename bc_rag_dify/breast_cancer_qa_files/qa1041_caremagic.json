  "Q": "I was in a car accident several months ago where my right breast and nipple area where brused from the seat belt, now the nipple has become inverted and skin has started to pucker I am also in alot of pain. I have had mamograms, ultrasounds, and an MRI, which doctors now think I have breast cancer also had biopsy ( waiting on results as we speak ). My question is could the accident have anything to do with whats going on now?",
