  "Q": "My wife has a chronic cough which according to the varios doctors that we have visited, is allergy and they generally give her Motaire and some cough syrup. These give marginal relief but the cough persists. Someone recommended SEACOD tablets which could boost her immunity and give permanant relief after sometime.Is this true and if so what should be the dosage of SEACOD. She is 53 yrs old.",
  "A": "Dear Friend. Chronic cough has multiple etiologies ranging from just allergy, asthma, COPD, Acidosis. Montair and other anti- histamines can control the situation acutely. But the question is to be sure about the etiology of Cough. Please review with us with her X-Ray of Chest and Mammogram. Till than she can take levocetzine 5Â mg once daily at night. Seacod capsules contains cod liver oil, which is an immune modulator, it helps in building the immunity. So, It's not a problem if she takes it. But it will not help in acute conditions.
