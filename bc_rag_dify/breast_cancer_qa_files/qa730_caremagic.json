  "Q": "Yes I m a 50 year old white female with a history of breast cancer and lupus. I started two weeks ago with a respiratory infection. They treated me one week with Doxy but did not improve, went back on that Friday and was given a Rocephin injection and steroid injection, my white count was 13.7 on Monday I was still no better and went back received another antibiotic injection and was given Prednisone 40mg to take daily for 5 days. Was admitted to the hospital on Thursday due to failed outpatient treatment. MY CXR has been ok no pneumonia but I m still short winded and feel like something is closing over my windpipe blocking my air. In the hospital my white count was 14.9 I was getting Rocephin and Zithromycin IV twice daily and SoluMedrol plus breathing treatments. My oxygen sat was around 92% then dropped to 90% on room air. I was discharged Saturday and did feel better, came home with Breathing treatments and Omnicef, Prednisone40 mg daily. Yesterday was awful I felt like everything was just like it was prior to being admitted. I am still having the feeling of something blocking my breathing at times and I have begun to cough again with some thick white sputum being produced. They seem to be puzzled as to what is going on because my blood cultures were clear for bacterial infections etc, CXR was alright the pulmonologist thinks it might be an underlying problem with my Lupus. However, today is awful again coughing, no energy short of breath etc. she is calling me in another steroid similar to what I took in the hospital and if no better might need to be readmitted. UGHHHHHHHHHHH any suggestions this is really getting the best of me. They did check for cardiac issues and blood clots and those were normal as well. Sorry to write so much but I was trying to give you a history. This has been going on now for more than two weeks.",
  "A": "Hi there... Thank you for such a detailed history. Reading your description I did think of Pulmonary embolism that is related to both SHE and breast cancer, but if your doctors have ruled that out then its shouldn't be a concern. I would still like to think of Interstitial lung disease and Pulmonary Hypertension as a possibility. Do discuss these differentials on your next visit to your doctors. Regards Chat Doctor. "
