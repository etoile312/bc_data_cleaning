  "A": "Hi, Liver disease can cause severe itching which is called as Hepatic pruritic. Treatment of this condition is done by treating the liver disease along with antihistamine tablets.  But as you have not mentioned clearly about the type and distribution, it would be difficult for me to comment about your rash and I advise you to consult your Dermatologist for proper diagnosis and treatment. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further."
