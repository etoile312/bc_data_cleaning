  "Q": "Hi, for the pat three weeks Ive had what my doctors think is a virus but Im not sure about that anymore. At first I had a really sore throat ( no strep), this eventually stopped. Then a runny nose and then a bad cough, eventually the runny nose stopped and the cough is slowly fading. Ive also had a lot of night sweating. Just recently though Ive had random Sharp pains through out my body and to top it off my left eye is swelling and my stomach is cramping alot.",
  "A": "Welcome to Chat Doctor. I understand your concern all the complaints you have mentioned here indicate that is definitely an infection that you are suffering from but to confirm it you should undergo a blood test mammogram as it can both differentiate between viral and bacterial infection.Also, cramps abdominal pain with night sweating indicates that you could also be having stomach infection now so do a stool routine test and along with both reports take opinion of general physician. No need to worry. Medications can cure infections. Hope I answered your query. Thanks and regards."
