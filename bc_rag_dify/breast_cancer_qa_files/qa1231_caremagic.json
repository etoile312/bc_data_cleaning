  "A": "Hi thanks for asking question. You have fibroadenomas like fibrotic disease according to USG. It is non-cancerous disease. Treated conservatively.NSAIDs Chat Doctor. Fluid can be aspirated. Take rest. Avoid excess tea and coffee. Supportive bra useful. You have also complained of nipple discharge. I would suggest you to do FNAC of mass just to be sure about non-malignant growth.
