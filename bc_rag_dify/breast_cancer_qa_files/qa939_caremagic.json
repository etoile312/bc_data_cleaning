  "Q": "My 85 year old mother had breast surgery last week (lumpectomy, right breast, 11:00) and now, 1 week later, is experiencing a very strong pain in her right buttock. I think it may be sciatica, or perhaps from not using that side for a week, it may be feeling strained. Any suggestions?",
  "A": "Hello, She should be first evaluated by a neurologist to determine whether it is truly sciatica or could there be another nerve root involved that may have been trapped DURING THE TIME OF SURGERY or was she not properly padded or were her legs not mobilized enough during the procedure to now cause this complication?  Once the neurologist has clinically identified the problem a decision can be made whether she can benefit from either an MRI of the lower spine and/or an EMG/NCV study that could potentially identify exactly where your symptoms are emanating from and give a better sense of how to go about relieving those symptoms.  I would follow this path if it were my elbow feelings these symptoms instead of performing an invasive procedure for which little or minimal investigation has been done to solidify an accurate or solitary diagnosis. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Take care Chat Doctor. "
