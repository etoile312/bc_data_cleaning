  "Q": "I had stage 1 ERPR pos, HER2 pos with a bilateral mastectomy in Aug. last year.  The borders were clear and I had 6 sessions of chemo, 17 o Herceptin, and have been on Tamoxifen for more than a year.  I have a small(about the size of a BB) lump near the inside bone of my ankle. Do I need to worry about this?  I am 48.",
  "A": "Hi! Thanks for writing to Chat Doctor sharing your health concerns! After going through your history of breast cancer, its treatment, prognostic markers and the lump in an unusual location like ankle bone, I would like to consider few possibilities like:1. A benign tumor or tumor-like condition for example ganglion, neurofibroma, Osceola, bursa etc...90% possibility2. Metastatic cancer possibility: 10% but really unfortunate as you are under treatment for a triple positive good prognostic group for breast cancer! Therefore, you must see a consultant doctor today for a close detailed examination and a simple needle biopsy to relieve your concerns! Hope this helps you."
