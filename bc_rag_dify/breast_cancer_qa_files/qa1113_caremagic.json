  "Q": "I took Fosamax from about 1995 thru 2003.  Because of acid reflux problems my dr. switched me to Evista.  Now I need to have a wisdom tooth extracted and am worried about jaw problems because of having taken the Fosamax.  The area is not painful.  The tooth has just broken.  Am wondering whether to go ahead with the extraction.",
  "A": "Hi. Can understand your concern. As per your complaint Osama contains Alien Chat Doctor. . On the other hand Vista contains Raloxifine and is Selective estrogen receptor modulator, and it also alters the bone loss but is not seen to cause osteoporosis, therefore you need not worry about getting extraction done as you have already been off Osama for more than ten years. But for being on a safer side consult an Oral Surgeon and get evaluated and a thorough clinical examination and evaluation for bone density has to be done for diagnosis and treatment can be done accordingly. Hope this information helps. Thanks and regards."
