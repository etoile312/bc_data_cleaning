  "Q": "My left breast has been hurting for about a month ago. I went to my doctor 2 weeks ago and she did an examination on my breast she said i had a few lumps and that there was nothing to worry about she prescribed vitamin e and motrin. For about a week the pain subsided but then it came back a few days ago and I feel sharp pain, a burning sensation, and under my armpit and back are itching a little. About when all this started I had an accident in the tub in which I landed on my left elbow with all my body weight I have no idea if this is the cause but it s really weird how my arm never hurt just my left breast. I m in so much desperation plz help....",
