  "Q": "Hi i am rakhi from Bangladesh. I was trying to have baby for 2 months, but was unsuccessful. Then i visited a doctor and  found hormone disorder and irregular period considered as a problem. After few medications my hormone became normal and she gave me Tab Letrozole 2.5mg along with gestrenol 5mg and folic tab. Meanwhile i read leaflet of letrozole what is used for.
