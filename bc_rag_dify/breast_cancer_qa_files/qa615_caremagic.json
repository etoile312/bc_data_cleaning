  "Q": "My mom is eighty years old in 1998 she had breast cancer removed the whole breast and all was good. 2010 she was told that she had lung cancer and also heart prolbems and fractured her hip all in a three month period.she went for  nine treatments of chemo. my question is her that her leg is killing her she cries it so bad. she on pain meds and still hurts. Is it possilble that the cancer spread to the bone",
  "A": "Hi, Thanks for writing in. It will help to get her examined clinically to rule out NY serious concern like a clot in the leg views. Many patients with history of cancers might develop a tendency of blood getting clotted in the deep veins of leg. This is known as deep vein thrombosis and is a life-threatening condition if not treated on time. However, this is not the only condition that can cause leg pain and other conditions must also be evaluated for. The pain in deep vein thrombosis is usually in the calf muscles and there is swelling and redness of the entire lower limb in many patients. Please consult her doctor and get her examined to clear bouts regarding any potentially dangerous condition. Spread of cancer to the bone is less like but not unheard of. This requires clinical examination. Please do not worry."
