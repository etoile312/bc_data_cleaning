  "A": "Hello and welcome to Chat Doctor I would keep a possibility of fungal infection. This is because closely opposing body folds e.g. thighs and groin, maxilla, submammary folds etc. can trap sweat, heat and moisture, therefore making the area favorable for fungal proliferation. If I was the treating doctor I would have asked you to use a topical antifungal like clotrimazole/ketoconazole/fluconazole cream, twice daily, regularly for 4 weeks. State AF cream contains topical terminating+mometasone. I would rather prefer a plain antifungal like clotrimazole/ketoconazole/fluconazole because mometasone if used for too long can cause side effects like skin atrophy and striaeSince you are already using an Oral antifungal e.g. oral terminating once daily. I would suggest you to continue with it for 4-6 weeks for a more complete urban OTC antihistamine e.g. cetirizine 10Â mg once daily would help you in symptomatic itch relief. Keeping the folds Chat Doctor. Regards"
