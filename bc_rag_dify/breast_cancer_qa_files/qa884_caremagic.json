  "Q": "33 year old male.....  Went this morning for pre-opp blood/lab work.  Im having a lump/mass removed from my left breast.  The doctor called and told me that my blood glucose level was 42 and I needed to come back in for more blood work.  What could be the reason behind the low glucose level?  Is it related to the lump in my chest?  Non-diabetic.  Thanks for your help",
  "A": "Hi, dear. I have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. You are suffering from hypoglycemia.  Your low sugar level is not related to your breast lump. Their are some other causes for your hypoglycemia.  You should go for investigation.  After your sugar level become normal then only you should go for surgery. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health."
