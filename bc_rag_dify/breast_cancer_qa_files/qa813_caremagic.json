  "Q": "Hi, I m a 49 yr old female. I found a small lumps on my right breast. There was in particular that was hard. I ve seen my Dr and was sent for a mammogram . The report came back no changes since my last mammogram 3yrs ago. My question is how do I know that everything that was felt actually showed on the mammogram. In the past I have had to go for a follow up ultra sound . I have had 2 friends misdiagnosed (from breast cancer ) and one is now deceased. I just want to make sure that everything was seen.. And if these are cysts I would like them drained (and hope that they don t return) That breast has grown bigger of the last year. Thank you",
  "A": "Hello welcome to Chat Doctor Thanks for your query, Mammogram can't give exact results always, When you palpate your breast you are feeling small lumps in the breast. Are they increasing in size?experiencing any pain? Any structural changes in the breast? If the lumps are large enough then go for FNAC (fine needle aspiration cytology) by a pathologist. If they are small enough go for ultrasound,it also differentiates a lump and a cyst. Consult general surgeon, and he will guide you Hope you understand my suggestionThank you Chat Doctor. "
