  "Q": "I have had ovarian cancer stage 3c and also had bowel reconstruction. This happened about ayear and a half ago. Now I have a lump about the size of a golf ball on my upper right side under my breast. It doesn t move and it doesn t hurt. I do get sharp pains on the lower right side every now and then. Could I have another cancer.",
  "A": "It is possible that you have another cancer, or that the ovarian cancer has spread. There is a genetic abnormality which you may have that causes both ovarian and breast cancer, as well as colon cancer. You need to have that lump checked out right away. Treatment can't be started until you know exactly what the lump is. Hope I have answered your query. If you have any further questions I will be happy to help."
