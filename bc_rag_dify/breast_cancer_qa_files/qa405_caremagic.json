  "Q": "my 73 years old mum has just diagnosed with early stage invasive lobular carcinoma with positive osestrogen receptor , positive HER2 ( 2+ ) and KI67",
  "A": "Hi and welcome to Chat Doctor. It can rarely be cured without surgery, and it is not advisable since surgery is the most appropriate way of management of such cancers. It can be associated with chemotherapy or radiation, but surgery is the mainstay of treatment today. Considering her age it is always questionable is surgery contraindicated, but this is some other question which depends on her general health. Thanks for the query. Wish you good health. Regards"
