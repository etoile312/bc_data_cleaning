  "Q": "I am a 30year old with a strong fam history of breat cancer , mother and grandmother. A lump was found 2 years ago and it has been watched with mammograms and ultrasounds every 6 months. I recently went in for blood work and my monocytes came back high.. 14. Just wondering if I should be worried. My fam doc says a biopsy of the breast is needed but dosent elaborate.",
  "A": "Hi there, a family history of ca breast has a very high incidence of breast cancer and so if you have a lump it is best to get a biopsy done to rule out any possibility of cancer. Early detection and treatment have an increased survival rate and is amenable to surgical cure. In fact, you should consult with a Genesis who can suggest tests in which they are able to do cytogenetic study which will be able to predict your chances of being cancer free and if not whether any preventive measure can be taken for a definitive treatment. Do follow your doctors advise and get a biopsy done. Take care."
