  "Q": "I had a mammogram and follow up ultrasound in November. A large cyst was diagnosed in my breast. A few weeks ago I got the flu and had a TERRIBLE cough. I developed pain in that same breast one day when I coughed extra hard. I think the cyst is now much smaller, and I m wondering if it is possible I ruptured the cyst that day. It is still quite painful although not as bad as it was. Is there any real danger I should be aware of, or will the pain eventually subside? I have my regular annual checkup with my OBGYN next week. Am I OK to wait to talk to her about it then?",
  "A": "Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. You may have some benign cyst. It may get ruptured or fluid may get absorbed, so it becomes smaller. If you don't have any other symptoms other than mild pain then no need to worry. You can wait for a week. There is no any urgency in that. Hope I have answered your question, if you have any doubts then contact me at bit.ly/ Chat Doctor. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health."
