  "Q": "Hello, I am really struggling with urinating, A brief history, I was diagnosed with bladder cancer in Nov. 2013, I had the tumors removed,but the cancer returned. My urologist told me I needed to have a systecomy as soon as possible, but I did not agree, so, I went to Seattle to another urologist and got a different opinion. We decided to start chemo and see how things progressed. things so far are very positive. My blood work is great, the tumors have not grown. Is there any new technology that I might try to help with my stream. Alan",
  "A": "Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. Treatment of bladder cancer depends on the type and stage of cancer.  However, partial or complete mastectomy is necessary. Then you should go for chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Consult your doctor and take treatment accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health."
