  "A": "Hello and thank you for using Chat Doctor. I carefully read your question and I understand your concern. I will try to explain and give you my opinion. You should know that when we treat hypertension our goal is to keep mean blood pressure values below 140 / 90 mmHg. I must say that values between 150-200 MMH are pretty high, and we should not leave them like that. But you should not worry about it. Hypertension is a chronic disease, it has hereditary factors, but you just have to find an adequate treatment and every think would be ok. In my opinion amlodipine 5 mg is a very small dosage for your high values. If I was your treating doctor I would recommend some examination like a cardiac echo to evaluate heart function and walls, a full blood analyze to check renal function and a holder pressure monitoring to see your mean blood pressure values during day and night. After all these we can better Jude what to do with your medical treatment. We can rise the amlodipine dosage up to 10 mg and add the class of medicament like a CE - inhibitors, blocker etc according to your previous examinations. Hope I was helpful. Best regards, Chat Doctor. "
