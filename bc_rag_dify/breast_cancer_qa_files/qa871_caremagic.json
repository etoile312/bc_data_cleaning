  "Q": "Hi. Im 17, 5 feet and 8 inches, and I weigh 120 pounds. I get stomach aches and nausea every night. Is this normal? I also get sick very easily (Im sick right now). My medical history is nothing crazy. My grandpa died of a heart attack, he had diabetes. And my grandma died of cancer. I am also paranoid that I might have breast cancer, but I am too scared to get it checked out. Ive felt my breasts before, but I cant tell if I have lumps or if thats just how my breasts are, because Ive had one lump in each breast since Ive developed them. One time before I went to shower, a little bit of puss came out of my left nipple, it made me worried but I dont want to go tell my mom this. Anything suspicious? Any advice?",
  "A": "Hi. Thanks for your query and an elucidated history. Is is not at all normal to get the stomach ache and nausea every night. This indicates that you have a problem of acidity and HERD. You are giving a history of being paranoid yourself, you can not have breast cancer at the age of 17. One lump each breast has to be investigated by getting physical examination, mammography and if the diagnosis is of a fibroadenoma or fibroadenomas, get the lump removed and get histopathological examination done to make sure that you do not have a cancer. There are many reasons of having pus from the nipples. Get investigated, get the pus culture and sensitivity done, and tell your Mother and the Doctor about this."
