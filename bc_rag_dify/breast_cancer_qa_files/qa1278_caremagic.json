  "Q": "Hi I have a lump on my aroela close to my nipple it been there since feb. 2011. I had my son in sept. And I breastfed for like three months and stopped cause my breast were too engorged so I put cabbage on them to drain the milk. Well yesterday I felt a pain in the lump and it looked like it wanted to pop so tonight I took a nice hot shower it popped right in white liquid came out also with thick white stuff and a little blood. So now Im trying to figure out what is going on. Please tell me this is nothing to worry about",
  "A": "Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. You have breast lump.  You may have galactose, inflamed cystic lesion or benign breast lesion.  Chances of cancer is low.  But you should go for mammography and fine needle aspiration cytology.  It will give you exact diagnosis. Then you should take treatment accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health."
