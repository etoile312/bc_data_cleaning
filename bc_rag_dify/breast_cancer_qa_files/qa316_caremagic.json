  "Q": "i want to know more about Australia Antigen as my Mom, who s in the third stage of breast cancer and recently identified by the Dr saying she s infected with Australia Antigen and it s very much dangerous for all as it spreads out very easily & faster.",
  "A": "Hi, Dear. Welcome to Chat Doctor. If your mother is Australia antigen positive it means she is suffering from Hepatitis B. Australia antigen is Hepatitis B surface antigen. A positive report means that the person has hepatitis B. This may be acute hepatitis, chronic hepatitis or carrier state. Precautions to be taken are not donating blood, not letting anyone have contact with one's blood in any way, not sharing needles. It is better to vaccinate all family members with hepatitis B vaccine., if unvaccinated. The healthcare person should be warned about this, to avoid touching blood, secretions with bare hands, taking care of needle pricks etc. Hope this answers your query. If you have additional questions or follow-up queries then please do not hesitate in writing to us. I will be happy to answer your queries. Wishing you good health."
