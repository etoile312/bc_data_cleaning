  "Q": "I have reoccurrence of breast cancer showing up in lymph nodes and have bone mattastis ...have been on flasodex for 5 months.... greatly reduced lymph nodes activity as had a pet/ ct scan last week. xgeva for 3 months but although good news is harmone blocking drug is working..... do not understand bone stuff....bone in leg femur is facratruing on its own......what is xgeva indicated to do positively for the bones....seems it may not be working. thanks any help will be appreciated. Carolyn",
  "A": "Hi, It's good to here you are responding to Rolodex as the lymph nodes size is reducing. The bone metastasis also likely to respond to Rolodex because commonly the bone metastasis occur if the tumor is positive to harmony receptors against which the Rolodex act. Neva reduces the bone turnover caused by the spread of tumor. The femur is a weight-bearing bone, so it may need fixation because the bone was already weakened by metastasis. So you need to consult your doctor for the same and continue the Neva to prevent further development of new metastasis. Hope I have answered your query."
