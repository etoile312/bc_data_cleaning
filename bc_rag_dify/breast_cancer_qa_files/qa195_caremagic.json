  "A": "Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor. Based on the facts of your query, You seem to have Pre-pubertal breast tissue, or could be a breast in formation as it forms between 8-14 yrs of age.Don't worry as it is not cancer. Still if worried, I would suggest, Check with Surgeon and get Second opinion on this and get mammogram done if need be. Contact with a Followup Premium question to ME. Will appreciate your Hitting thanks and writing excellent review comments to help needy patients like you. Good Day! Chat Doctor. S. Genl-CVTS"
