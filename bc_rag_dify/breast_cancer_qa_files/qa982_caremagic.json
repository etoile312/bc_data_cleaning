  "A": "Hi, Thanks for writing in to us. Cancer is a challenging condition and is different in every patient. It is the uncontrolled proliferation of abnormal cells involving different organs. Breast cancer might be treated but might spread through blood to the lungs. This is called homogeneous spread. The cause for it is deposition of cancer cell sin other organs even when the primary cancer is treated. This is advanced disease and requires aggressive treatment. Please do not worry."
