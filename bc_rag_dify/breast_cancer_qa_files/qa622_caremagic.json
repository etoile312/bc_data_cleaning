  "A": "**1. Menopause is not a disease but a natural life-stage transition, which mainly involve hormone imbalance resulting in above said symptoms, so you have to carefully make important decisions regarding treatment apart from HRT [hormone replacement therapy] i.e. taking Regeneron [steroid progestin]2. As the levels of hormones fluctuate, the menstrual cycle begins to change, i.e. some women may have longer periods, others will begin to miss periods [7 months in your case]3. Herbal medicines have been used to relieve these symptoms for centuries, and there is no substantial evidence that herbal products are a source of toxic reactions, but because herbal products are not regulated in the United States, contamination or accidental overdose is possible, thus you should learn as much as possible about herbs and work with a qualified practitioner.4. Avoid Polyunsaturated Omega-6 fats [Eat fats like quality organic meats, butter, coconut oil, ghee, olive oil, can help boost proper hormone production.]5. Focus on relaxing exercises like walking or swimming and avoid the extended running, cardio and exercise videos."
