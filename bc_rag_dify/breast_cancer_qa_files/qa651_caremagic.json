  "Q": "I have had neck pain in the back of my neck for about 3 months. At first I thought it was stress, but I also have glands that swell off and on. My throat would feel swollen and I would think I was getting sick, but the next day I would feel fine. This happened for about two weeks. Then my left armpit began to swell. It, also goes up and down. I thought maybe I had mono or was allergic to my deodorant, but it just doesn t go away even though I have changed deodorants and am not having flu like symptoms. I went to my gynecologist and she felt a lump in my left breast. I had an exploratory mammogram and an ultrasound, but they said I was fine. My gynecologist says that I have dense breast tissue which could mask a lump during tests like I had. She wants to recheck me. Are the neck, glands or lump issue related? Should I be worried? I am 52 years old. YYYY@YYYY",
  "A": "As per your explanation I understand you have lymph node swelling under your arm and below the breast area towards later side. Here I suggest you need to understand lymphatic system is the one which carries waste metabolic end product from different part of our body to kidney and heart to get it filter here. And this lymphatic channels are present all over the body even in our fingers too. Lymph node is an oval-shaped organ of the lymphatic system, distributed widely throughout the body including the armpit and stomach and linked by lymphatic vessels. Lymph nodes are major sites of B, T, and other immune cells. Lymph nodes are important for the proper functioning of the immune system, acting as filters for foreign particles and cancer cells. Lymph nodes do not deal with toxicity, which is primarily dealt with by the liver and kidneys. If you feel there is a swelling in lemonade which is increasing and getting tender day by day then I suggest do not wait and visit your gone immediately along with a vascular surgeon to for having better idea on your issue. My aim is not to panic you but if there is anything related to cancer then early detection and treatment will help you to get cure easily. And neck pain can be possible with this. So I suggest first you need to evaluate on lymph node swelling and take treatment for it. Later still if neck pain continue you can visit or tho and physio for further advice and treatment. Take care."
