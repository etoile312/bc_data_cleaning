  "Q": "above my right areola, is a light brown discoloured area, and has been present about a week or less, please tell me this isnt CANCER!!! im so scared and only have male doctors around here. PLEASE HELP! other than this, im completely healthy! not on any current meds for anything",
  "A": "First, carefully examine your breasts standing in front of the mirror. You can visit any of the sites that describe self breast examination. If there is a lump palpable then immediately consult an oncologist even if he's a male. If there is no lump, then get an ultrasound or mammogram of the breast done. If it is normal, then there is nothing to worry about. Just keep the area under surveillance. It will most likely disappear."
