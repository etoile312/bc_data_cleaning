  "Q": "I got off birth control in January and started taking pre-natal vitamins. My husband and I have been trying to conceive ever since. My last period was August 16, 2010; however, on September 20, I started spotting and I have been spotting ever since. I have taken two preganancy tests, which botChatDoctore out negative. Could I still be pregnant?",
  "A": "His have gone through your complaints.I can understand your anxiety to conceive. As your spotting and urine pregnancy tests ate negative It's unlikely to have pregnancy. Wait for 1 wk and repeat the test. Symptoms of pregnancy will be amenorrhea (missed periods)or morning sickness like nausea, vomiting and breast tenderness .some people say spotting but still pregnant but pregnancy test will be positive. Do the test with early morning sample.don't feel tense.consult an obstetrician & plan for pregnancy. Thank Vasundhara"
