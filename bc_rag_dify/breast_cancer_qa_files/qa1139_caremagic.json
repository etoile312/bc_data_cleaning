  "Q": "my mom was diagnose with breast cancer a few days ago. she had a median size lump under her armpit which was swollen and hurt her , as for her breast there is a large lump which is painless but there is some swelling in her breast and you can see the compassion to the other one which is not swollen. she went to the doctor and she said that they drain some fluid from her breast and under her armpit and test it and it was proven that the cells were indeed cancer. they told her that they have to run more testes to see weather it have spread. but she will be getting more results till the 14th of this month ( November) . they did not told her what stage cancer she has or what type or strand of cancer. i am really worried because i read online about inflammatory breast cancer which is the really bad one. is that the only type of cancer that cause painless swelling in the breast with a lump and cause a painful lump under the armpit? thank you for your time and answers i appreciate it.",
  "A": "Dear, Aspiration cytology test must have been performed on your mother which showed signs of malignancy. You have to do the true cut biopsy to know more parameters. For staging they need to have more tests like bone scan, CT scan of chest and abdomen and some blood tests to finally declare what stage it is. I feel your mother must be post menopausal and things will do better once the tumor is completely removed. Results still depend on what they find after removing the tumor like lymph node status and hormonal status. Over all prognoses should be good."
