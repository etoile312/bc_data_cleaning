  "Q": "Hello Doctor, following is regarding my mother Patient History: Besides being diabetic, she was attacked with Breast Cancer in 2002. Mastectomy followed by chemo and radiation.Due to radiation effect, she developed respiratory problems and we were in consultation with Pulmonologist .While she had no cardiac problem, but we were consulting cardiologist from past 5 years and things that side are in order. Current Problem: As indicated above, she is suffering from respiratory problem due to radiation. This being winter, she is often having chest congestion and we are consulting pulmonologist. What we observed is that often she is having gastric problem which is causing an upward pressure on her lungs thereby making breathing difficult (pls excuse my layman understanding if wrong). She was taking Sompraz D 40 mg in the morning empty stomach as advised by Doctor earlier (now pulmonologist changed it to Ganaton Total-from past few days). But there is no much improvement. Please advise if she needs to take any other medicine in the evening as it is becoming very difficult during nights. Following is the list of medicines she is taking. May be her gastric problem is due to huge medicine intake. Pls advise Diabetes- InsulinGlytop SR 10 mg Heart RelatedDeplatt 75 mg (Clopidogrel)TG TOR (Atorvastatin)Nitrocontin (nitroglycerin) Calcium/Multi VitaminFoscal-ICobadex RespiratoryFexovis-M (Fexofenadine Montelukast)Lukotas-3D (Montelukast, Acebrophyline, Levocetrizine Hydrochloride)Omnacortil (this is a steroid and is given for a limited period of 3-5 days)Deryphillne OD",
  "A": "Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. According to my opinion your respiratory problems may not be due to radiation treatment.  You should continue medication for your gastric problems.  Go for x-ray chest.  You may have some chronic respiratory disease.  Then take treatment accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health."
