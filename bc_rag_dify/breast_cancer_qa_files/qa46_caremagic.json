  "Q": "Am having irregular periods for the past one year. Last month my endometrium was thickened and i underwent a DNC. After that ,my doctor gave me REGESTORNE tablet through which i got my periods this month. Now my doctor has given me NOVELON tablets for 3 cycles to regularise my periods. Is it safe to use Novelon tablet? Am scared whether i ll put weight if i take the tablet. Will i not get my periods regularly without using Novelon tablets?",
