  "Q": "I have a history of cancer in my family my dad died of lung cancer and my mum had her breast off with breast cancer I have had stress and had a blood test taken at my gp and they say I have problem with viscosity and Immunoglobulins can any of these bloods be a sign that I may have cancer",
  "A": "Hi, Thanks for writing in. Sorry to hear about your father and hope your mum has won her battle against cancer. Some cancers run in the families and some evolve by themselves. There are genes which are markers for certain cancers but every one having the marker might not get the disease. Immunoglobulins are certain proteins that are part of the immune mechanism. Medical literature says that there is a traditional view that immunoglobulins produced only by differentiated B lymphocytes has been challenged as immunoglobulin genes have been found to be expressed in hematopoietic human cancer cells. However, this phenomenon has not been widely accepted, and knowledge about this newly discovered concept is limited.Therefore, a lot of research on individual immunoglobulins is going on and there is a lot of knowledge still to be discovered in this area. Please do not worry."
