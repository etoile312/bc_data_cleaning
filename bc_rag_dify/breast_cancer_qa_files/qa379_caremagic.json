  "A": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your mothers situation and problem. Yes, you are right about ultrasound examination of abdomen. It should be done first to rule out liver metastasis or liver enlargement. If this is normal then no need to worry about metastasis. Get done liver function test (LFT). This includes Bilirubin, SGPT and GOT levels. In some cases liver on ultrasound can be normal, but if liver function tests are raised then Hepatitis can be the cause for her right sided abdominal pain. So get done liver function test. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wishing good health to your mother. Thanks."
