  "Q": "I have just had my 3rd non-cancerous breast surgery in 3 weeks. My surgeon called and told me I have MRSA and put me on Clindamycin HCL from the pathologist s report. I was in the hospital 15 months ago for MRSA from a fall and small elbow cut. Is this contagious now and should I be in the hospital? I was in the infectious disease department of the hospital last year. I do have a drain in my breast from Thursday s surgery.",
  "A": "Hi madam.thanks for contacting us...MRSA is type of bacteria that resist some species of antibiotics...u must know that there is MRSA infected patient and MRSA carrier personnel...MRSA infected patient have symptoms and signs of the disease .but carrier state have no symptoms or signs ...if u had done 3 specimen culture on different times that means it was eradicated .and no fear of it....u may be the carrier state and the carrier is not infectious to others....so briefly after treatment you are not infectious to others...my advice is u do specimen culture on 3 different times to be complete assured.....and don't carry madam about that.I thank u because of your concern about be contagious to others ...that's great....finally take care of your health .thank u"
