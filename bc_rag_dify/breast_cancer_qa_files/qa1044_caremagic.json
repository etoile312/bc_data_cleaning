  "A": "Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. Treatment of choice depends on stage of cancer. She should go for bone scan also to search for metastasis.  She should go for modified radical mastectomy (complete breast removal surgery.) with lymph node dissection. Then she should go for chemotherapy and receptor antagonist therapy if her ER, PR and Her2 new is positive. Consult your doctor and take treatment accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health."
