  "Q": "Thank you .... I am stage 4 breast cancer to the bone.  I have been doing chemo therapy for the past 4 months.  Over the past few weeks I have noticed a white rubbery subtance in my tool, and a significant amount.  My stomache usually hurts badly before I have a BM.  Is this something I should be concerned about, or is this the chemo, or even cancer cells exiting my body?  Thank you.",
  "A": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. In my opinion you are having stomach infection. Chemotherapy makes patient immunosuppressive, so infections are more common. And gastrointestinal tract can easily infect by uncooked food or unhygienic water. So mostly you are having infection in stomach that is why you are having stomach problems and stool problems. So get done stool examination to rule out infection. Start antibiotics accordingly."
