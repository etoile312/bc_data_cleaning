  "Q": "a family member has metastised breast cancer to the R lung, liver and brain.  While the liver and brain are under control for the moment, the lung seems to be spreading quickly.  The doctors are removing about 1 litre of fluid every 5 days, and she is on 8-12 L of O2.  A cat scan has revealed that the tumor has doubled in 2 wks, and the left lung is showing some shadows.  She is scheduled for pic line tomorrow. How long do you think she has?",
  "A": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your situation and problem. Breast cancers usually have good prognosis if detected early and treatment started promptly. Since your relative has advanced (metastatic) Breast cancer, this carries poor prognosis. Lung metastasis with recurrent malignant pleural effusion further worsen the survival rate. Life expectancy in his/her case is less than 1 year. And five year survival rate is less than 5%. So better to discuss end of life issues with him/her."
