  "Q": "I had a mild stroke in 2013. I was fine, just playing Scrabble with my husband, when a warm sensation traveled from my lower extremities through the urinary tract and within minutes my left eye became impaired and I lost vision in that eye. I naturally thought it was an ocular migraine since I ve gotten many in the past with auras around the eyes but this seemed concentrated in the left eye only. NO OTHER STROKE SYMPTOMS...I immediately went to the kitchen to chew a 325 aspirin and my husband called my eye doctor because I do have Glaucoma and a history of very debilitating migraines. I also have A-fib. It ended up being a stoke and no one knows whether it came from the eye or the A-fib. although I wasn t presenting with A-fib at this time and believe me, I KNOW WHEN I HAVE A-FIB--very symptomatic. Today I had that warm sensation travel up my body just like before but without loss of vision, no face droopiness, no numbness in arms, speech OK, just scared to death. Grabbed another aspirin...I ve been taking Plavix for 2 months but there are so many side effects I was going to quit it tonight and go back to the 81 mg. aspirin...now I ve had my aspirin for the day. I was lying down when this happened and my back [middle] was hurting me a lot but I do have LUMBAR and Cervical spine issues. I also cannot tolerate blood thinners or anti-arrhythmic drugs. I m a cancer survivor as well [breast cancer]. What was that unusual warm sensation? It scared me because it was just like the one I had last year. I feel OK now but still shaky and was tempted to just go to the ER but I m savvy about medicine having worked in 2 hospitals and NIH for 32 years. I also have Hyponatremia if that helps any. Have trouble holding blood sodium levels in the normal range. Thank you. Sally",
  "A": "Hi, thank you for providing the details about your health condition. What I am able to understand is the metabolism of your cells needs a booster along with the immune system. Usually performing regular - meditation, Breathing exercises, general body exercises, will help improve the metabolism. As you are a cancer survival and Stroke as well, you need to focus on improving the cellular Metabolism. As body is the medicine of its own, many major issues are taken care by body. Also, for the neck and back pain you need to see a physical therapist who by using the therapeutic ultrasound therapy and TENS therapy will help reduce pain. Besides neck and back spine Strengthening exercises are advised to improve your body. Body if not in momentum will lead to the lack of the cellular functioning and later end up anywhere, where there are weak zones. Also, by doing the regular exercises the Chat Doctor. I hope you understand the importance of exercises. Maybe it is little to do a day but with little only the bigger improvement comes. Also, after stroke, breast cancer, cervical and lumbar spine issues you need to perform physical therapy to improve the Metabolism, immune system and get strength. You can discuss the same with the physician.regards Jay In"
