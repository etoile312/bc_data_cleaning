  "Q": "I am a 35 year old who underwent a mini CABG off pump using my right internal mammary as a conduit in August 2010 (had sudden cardiac damage due to a congenital right coronary anamoly).  Since then, the right side of my chest feels significantly heavier then my left side and I experience intermittent episodes of right arm pain which last several hours at a time.  Are these common post-surgical symptoms or should I be concerned?",
  "A": "Hi Thereafter reading your medical details I would like to advise you that whenever you feel that heaviness again try to get one ECG done at that time if that ECG doesn't show any ST T changes then you need not worry. Sometimes while taking out the RIMA from the chest some part of nerves also gets affected which later on causes the symptoms that could be the areas on in your case. If there are no dynamic changes in the ECG you need not worry. For your right side discomfort you can talk with your surgeon. Good Luck"
