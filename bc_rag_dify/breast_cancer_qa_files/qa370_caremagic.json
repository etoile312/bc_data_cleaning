  "Q": "I had bc 10 years ago with lumpectomy, all nodes taken out but clear, rads & chemo. Now new lump same breast, hypoechoic & peripheral vasculArity highly sispicious of primary malignancy but on core needle biopsy today, surgeon could hardly find it & thought the tumour seemed like it was empty. He said the needle just went straight through it. I ve got no idea what this could mean & had no time to ask.",
  "A": "Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. You have history of breast cancer, so there is chance that it may be recurrence, or it may be some other benign disease. You should wait for core biopsy report. It will give you exact idea regarding lesion then take further decision accordingly. Hope I have answered your question. If you have any doubts then feel free to ask me. I will be happy to answer.
