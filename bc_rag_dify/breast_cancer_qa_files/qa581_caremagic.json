Check your bone strength with DEXA SCAN and you can start medication according to level of osteoporosis, You need to start supplement of calcium with vitamin D, it B12, and if osteoporosis is severe then bisphosphonates can be started. I will advise you to do regular physiotherapy and exercises as my patients find much relief by these therapies. You need to take diet rich in calcium and vitamin D. Hope this answers your query.
