  "Q": "I have rashes on my inner thigh that are red, circlular raised rings,and  stops at the spot where my thigh and crotch intersect. I wear briefs but fill uncomfortable in any thing else,I dont sweet much but it could have been the cause,I am a virgin so it isnt sexually transmitted,and also it stated of really bad on 1 side and a few months later stated lightly on the other side. I applied a cream suggested by my doctor and that cured it however left large black marks and now it is happening again..how to get rid of the black marks as they look really ugly",
  "A": "Hello and welcome to Chat Doctor I would keep a possibility of fungal infection. This is because closely apposing body folds e.g. thighs and groin, maxilla, submammary folds etc. can trap sweat, heat and moisture, therefore making the area favorable for fungal proliferation. If I was the treating doctor I would have asked you to use a topical antifungal like clotrimazole cream, twice daily, regularly for 4 weeks. An Oral antifungal e.g. fluconazole once weekly for4 -6 weeks OR oral terminating once daily for 2-4 weeks, is also advisable for a more complete urban OTC antihistamine e.g. cetirizine 10Â mg once daily would help you in symptomatic itch relief. Keeping the folds Chat Doctor. Regards"
