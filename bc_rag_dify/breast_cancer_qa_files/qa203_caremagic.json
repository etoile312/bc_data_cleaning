  "A": "Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. Chemotherapy is needed in breast cancer.  If after complete removal of breast, biopsy report doesn't show cancer then chemotherapy is not required.  Please send me your biopsy reports or consult your doctor and plan accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health."
