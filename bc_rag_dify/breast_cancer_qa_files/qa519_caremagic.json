  "Q": "I just discovered a red bump on the outside gum of my 4 year olds daughters tooth. Its very red. Shes not complaining of it but 2 weeks ago was complaining of cheek pain. Im freaking out a bit because I just finished treatment for breast cancer and Im scared its mouth cancer :( anything I should be looking for? Im calling her dentist first thing in the morning. Thank u.",
  "A": "Hello dear, It seems you are very much worried and anxious, So First don't worry and be relaxed. I will provide you with my best possible advice.Don't look for any other thing as you are already calling the dentist next morning as he will diagnose the problem and initiate the treatment. As per my opinion Most probably your daughter may be suffering from any infection of the gums most commonly herpetic dermatitis, which recovers without any treatment within 10 days. Hope this will help you. Thank YouTube Disregards"
