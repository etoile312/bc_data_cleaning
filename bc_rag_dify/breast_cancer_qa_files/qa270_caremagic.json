  "Q": "Eye ball sized non moving lump beneath left rib cage under breast. Does not hurt to touch but I have tenderness when moving/twisting that radiates from left to right across both rib cages. Two weeks prior to this finding I found 3 breast lumps on left breast after the quick (within days) onset of swelling and misshapen appearance with pain localized to the swelling. Left axilla swollen for about 3 months with soreness in chest above left breast and shoulder pain extending to my back all left side.",
