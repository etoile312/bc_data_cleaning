  "Q": "Today my insurance company said Tomoxifen was a chemo therapy drug. I believe it is hormone therapy. My insurance is charging me 4 times more for this drug because they say it is not going to apply to my deductible because it is a chemo therapy drug. I do live in Oklahoma (Idiot backward state) . The lady at the Scott & White insurance company told me that in Oklahoma - this is considered a chemo- therapy drug. Is that true?",
  "A": "Tamoxifen is hormonal therapy and not chemotherapy. It is indicated if estrogen and progesterone receptors are positive in biopsy sample. It is used metastatic breast cancer in men and women.
