  "Q": "Hi! I have been married for 5 and a half years, but still not able to concieve. 2 years back I had a D & C to remove a polyp due to which I had irregular menstural bleeding. After D & C, my periods have been regulated to some extent. Then about 6 month ago, I had my periods disappeared for 2 months, which on diagnosis doctor determined a cyst in my ovary. she gave me injection of IVF-C 1/m stat and tablet primolute-N for 3days, after which i get my periods back to normal. Now, in order to concieve, my gynaecologist Dr. Shaheen Zaffar gave me Ovi-f for 3 cycles, but still i didnt concieve. Now , after one month gap, she recommended me Lezra (letrozole 2.5 mg) for 3 cycles. to be taken from 1st to 5th day of mensus. I come to know from few sources, tht lezra is given for the cure of breast cancer. I want to ask can I take this drug for my case (infertility), as suggested by my doctor?",
  "A": "Hi, Ezra (that has metronome) helps in inducing the release of egg from the ovary and hence, increases chances of pregnancy.  An ovarian cyst can sometimes affect ovulation decreasing chances of pregnancy, but it may depend on the size and type of the cyst in the ovary. If a similar patient comes to my clinic, I would recommend taking metronome medication.  Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Take care Chat Doctor. "
