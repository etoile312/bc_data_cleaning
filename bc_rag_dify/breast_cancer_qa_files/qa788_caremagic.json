  "A": "Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. You have uterine fibroid. No Chat Doctor.  Surgery is the only treatment of choice. If your family is completed then you can go for hysterectomy.  If you want to preserve that then you should go for mastectomy. Consult your doctor and plan accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health."
