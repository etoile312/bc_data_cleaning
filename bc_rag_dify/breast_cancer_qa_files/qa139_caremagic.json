  "Q": "I was sick with some type of flu the whole month of Jan. About three days into my illness i noticed a large lump next to my right breast in my armpit. I went to urgent care the same day and the dr. looked at it and said it looked like my lymph node might be swollen but seemed more concerned with me being sick(congested in my bronicals,completely clogged up sinuses,headache and terrible body aches) gave me antibiotics. Now  that its Feb. Im feeling better but the lump is still there and its painful and I have pain running over the top part of my breast and down my arm and sometimes in my back. Its a stinging, burning type of pain and the lump is soft and I can move it a little.",
  "A": "Hi.it is best if you consult with a doctor, preferably a general surgeon, for medical and physical examination. Based from your description, it could be an inflamed lymph node secondary to an infection or a cyst, a benign breast lesion. It could also be a fibrous or fibrotic lesion. These lesions are best evaluated clinically. Further diagnostic examinations, such as breast ultrasound and mammography (which also includes axillary evaluation), will be requested as needed. Regular breast examination and follow-up with your doctor is highly recommended in these cases.  Management (medical and/or surgical) will be directed accordingly. Hope this helps. Good day!!~ Chat Doctor. "
