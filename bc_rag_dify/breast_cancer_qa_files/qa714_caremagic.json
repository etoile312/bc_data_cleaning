  "Q": "last year my 15 year old daughter had redness and swelling in her right breast. I immediately took her to the dr. Had a mammogram...it came back benign. They tried to drain it at first but it wasn t anything there. Now the same breast is causing these same problems...What could it be? Help",
  "A": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. In my opinion you should not worry much for cancer in your daughter. She is in pubertal age. So many hormonal changes are occurring at a same time. And this changes can cause benign breast swelling which is having on and off appearance. Your biopsy report is also negative so no need to worry much. Mostly this swelling will subside by its own once hormonal imbalance settle down. Mostly after 17-18 years all the female hormone s are becoming normal and so the changes due to them are also getting normal. So no need to worry much for your daughters breast lump."
