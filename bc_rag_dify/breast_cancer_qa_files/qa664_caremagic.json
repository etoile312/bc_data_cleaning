  "Q": "I have breast cancer.  I had radiation treatment over two months ago.  I am experiencing extreme pain (10) on my breast and back.  I cannot use my left arm where they removed my lymph nodes.  The pain is almost unbearable.  I cannot wear a bra, any tight clothes, and everything hurts.  Is this normal.  The doctor has me on pain medicine, steriods, cancer medicine.  It is progressively getting worse.  What can help?  Elaine",
  "A": "HIT hank for asking to ChatDoctorI am sorry for your health condition, but no need to worry the pain is the most disturbing event in every cancer case, but this will go away soon with the time, you will have to wait little more time for adaptation once the adaptation sets up then you won't feel more pain it is like double sword the surgical procedure and the radiotherapy but no need to worry every thing will be fine soon have great day."
