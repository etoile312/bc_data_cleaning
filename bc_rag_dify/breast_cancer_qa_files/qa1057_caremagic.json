  "Q": "I have a family history of breast cancer including my mother and her sister. I have had a lump in my right breast for several years. Monitored yearly with mammograms and MRIs. I ve had a pain under my right armpit for over 8 months and just recently realized that the (pencil point size bump) has grown and seems to be 2 separate lumps under the skin. I had it checked only to find that 2 more lumps have appeared in my breast (one in the left and a second in the right) since my last mammogram just 6 months ago . The lumps under my arm are painful......should I be concerned??",
  "A": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. In my opinion you should first get done biopsy of the1. Breast lump2. Axillary swellingSince you have strong family history of breast cancer, chances of malignant transformation of breast lump are high. So we need to rule out malignancy first. Even if lumps are benign, I would suggest removing the lumps surgically to decrease the future chances of malignancy. So get done biopsy first to confirm the diagnosis."
