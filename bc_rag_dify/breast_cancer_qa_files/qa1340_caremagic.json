  "A": "1. Cancer has spread to lungs and rib cage, Metastasis is there, which itself means grave condition, thus prognosis is not good.2. This is stage IV of CA and whether TNM Classification was done?3. Were Tumor Markers test carried out, and whether they find out that CA is hormone positive or negative?4. Any family history?, her lifestyle, any addiction, use of OC pills, Weight, diet rich in fat?5. At this age and stage apart from medicine she needs emotional and group support6. Ayurveda medicines can be given along with Chemo/Radio-Therapy which helps in slowing the progress of the Tumor., you can contact with an Ayurveda Physician there for the same."
