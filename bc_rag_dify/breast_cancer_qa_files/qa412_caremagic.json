  "Q": "I have an area at my inside part of my knee where the skin is terribly painful - the pain moves or grows and becomes larger. Or starts at one sport and if I dont treat it quickly will move higher or lower areas of the body. Not on my face though. I have this maybe once a year or once in two years. Warm bath and Vicks used to help. This time its worse. I find a heating pad helps a lot as well as a warm bath. Then you can only feel the inner muscle pain but not the pain on the skin. Aleve dit help.",
  "A": "Hai.your pain can be due to local trauma, or inflammation, arthritis, or injury to the ligaments, meniscus, or tenosynovitis, or to the muscle tissue you can go for cold compression rather than warm please meet an orthopaediacian, & get investigated for MRI of the knee to know the exact problem. Please rule out for problems like rheumatoid problems, other inflammation witChatDoctorplete mammogram, esr, blood sugar level stake care"
