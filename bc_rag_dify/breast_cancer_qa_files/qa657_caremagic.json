  "Q": "My mom died this pass Jan.7, 2010 from breast cancer. She was confused and seeing things differently. The cancer has spreaded through her whole body even her brain!  After being in the hospital for over a month she wasnt waking up one early morning going into a coma-like state. How can the cancer in her brain cause her not be able to wake up?",
  "A": "Hi.if the cancer has spread into her brain, these lesions could affect the integrity of the structures affected by it (such as important blood vessels, motor and sensory rooms in our brain, etc.). These tumors/lesions could compress and vascularly compromise those structures leading to a wide spectrum of symptomatologic. Unless, the primary or the metastatic course is controlled, the symptoms will persist. Hope this helps. Good day!!~ Chat Doctor. "
