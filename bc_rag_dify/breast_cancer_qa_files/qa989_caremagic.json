  "Q": "Hi, my name is Jennifer. My insurance was recently cut that is why I am here. I have a pituitary adenoma, a heart condition, I m anemic, and may have acute arthritis. Today I woke up with extreme pain in my left nipple, my breast lactate because of the tumor but I know its not a clogged duct. It kind of feels like my nipple is being stretched out. It s just my nipple not the entire areola. It s only happening on the left one a well. Breast cancer runs on both sides of my family. And my first cousin on my mothers side just had a lump removed and she s only 24. I m 21 years old and want to know what I should do? Right now I have a warm comprise on it and it did reduce the swelling and pain some but not much.",
  "A": "Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern.  Breast cancer is very rare at your age.  Your symptoms are not of breast cancer. So first no need to worry. Just be relaxed. You're swelling and pain in breast may be due to pituitary tumor.  Bromocriptin is very helpful Chat Doctor.
