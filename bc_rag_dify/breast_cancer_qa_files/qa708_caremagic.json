  "Q": "Persistent pelvic pain concentrated on right side, swollen lymph nodes -nickle size-in groin for more than 4 months increasing in size. Some lymph nodes on left side now swollen. throbbing pain right groin/flank increases with pressure (pain stays at 3-4..distracting but not intolerable), temp does not exceed 1 degree over normal. Still have Appendix. History: Had partial hysterectomy in Feb 12, history of benign cyst on ovary. History of Pyelonephritis and urinary tract infections. Last one treated  in Dec 12. 2 C section deliveries, no failed pregnancies, 1 surgery for adhesions, gall bladder removed. Current urinary quick test negative. Family history of ovarian and breast cancer.  Have been to the GYN that did the partial Hysterectomy...who referred me to a Urologist who says maybe it is interstitial cyctitis....but the paid is so concentrated on right side... it does not seem logical.What do you think?",
  "A": "Hi ! From the data you have submitted, it seems that ovaries were not removed during partial hysterectomy. With a family history of ovarian and breast cancer, I would advise you to seek the advice of your gynecologist for getting an ultrasound and CT scan of your abdomen to exclude any ovarian pathology. Simple appendicitis will not likely give rise to such swollen lymph nodes on both sides of groin. Well cystitis and urinary tract infection could be associated, but do not explain the swollen lymph nodes. If need be and advised by your doctor, you can go for a serial CA 125 level test in your blood. I suggest not to delay and seek appropriate second specialist opinion. Wish you an early recovery. Good luck."
