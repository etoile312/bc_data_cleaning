  "Q": "I have been feeling like I am pregnant. I ve had the implanon in for 2.5 years and I feel movement in my stomach and I have gained at least 5lbs. I m shocked because I work out at least 3 times a week. My last menstrual cycle was the 24th of July. I know it may be soon to tell but I just have a strong feeling. I have done 4 pregnancy test and they all came out negative...is there a possibility that I may be pregnant?? Can the implanon give multiple false negative??",
  "A": "Hello, and I hope I can help you today. If your pregnancy tests are negative, then you are not pregnant.  The Implant will not cause a false-positive pregnancy test.  However, the hormone in the Implant, called Progesterone, can cause many similar symptoms to pregnancy, because the same kind of hormone is produced in your body by pregnancy.  So feeling bloated, having breast tenderness, spotting or irregular periods and weight gain can all just be side effects of the Implant.  Many women think they feel fetal movements, but most women don't feel fetal movement until they are at least four to five months pregnant, so you are likely mistaking the movements of your intestines for fetal movement. I suggest you discuss your situation with your healthcare provider, as you may prefer to try an alternate method of birth control which may not give you these symptoms.  Your Implant will need to be replaced at 3 years anyway, and other hormonal contraceptives that are not systemic, like the hormonal IUD, can give long-term pregnancy protection without as many systemic side effects. I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today and that this information was helpful. Best wishes,"
