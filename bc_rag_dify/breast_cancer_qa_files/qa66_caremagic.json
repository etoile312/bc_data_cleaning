  "Q": "im 37 y/o, female, asian. my mother had breast CA. I am a little bit worried because there is a bruise-like discoloration on my right breast and its been there for over a month. It is not painful, no lumps, no warmth, and does not seem thickened. i did notice two black spots on the areola. should i be worried?",
  "A": "HI, thanks for using Chat Doctor There is an increased risk of breast cancer if there is a family history of disease but this increased risk does not mean that you will definitely get this disease but that you need to monitor yourself. The bruise on your breast may just be an indicator of a small vein burst. It is not a normal presentation of breast cancer. You may want to consider the tests for the bra 1 and bra 2 genes. These genes make tumor suppressor proteins which are proteins that reduce the chance of breast cancer. Persons with abnormalities with these genes are at increased risk breast cancer. I hope this helps"
