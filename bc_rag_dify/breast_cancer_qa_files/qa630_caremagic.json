  "Q": "I had a mammogram on yesterday and was called back today to say that there was some asymmetric tissue in my left breast, with no sign of a mass. But, I was scheduled or another mammogram and an ultra sound on Monday. I also am on a maintenance chem regime because I was diagnosed with follicular lymphoma in 2013, but the disease is in remission. I have chem every 2 months. Can this also cause some changes in my breast tissue?",
  "A": "Hi, Thanks for writing in. It is rare to find two different cancers in a patient, but this is not unheard of. The possibility of chemotherapy for follicular lymphoma causing breast cancer is less. However, there is a slight chance of cancer in the breast if you have received radiation therapy for your previous cancer. There are studies which have shown that radiation therapy for lymphoma might put the patient at slight risk of another cancer. However, since there is no obvious mass in the breast region therefore the likelihood of a cancer is less. Since there is a suspicious finding on mammography therefore confirming it with ultrasound is important. Please do not worry."
