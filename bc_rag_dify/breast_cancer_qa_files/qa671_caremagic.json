  "Q": "Hello Sir, my wife was facing a problem of Periods irregularity and consulted doctor. The doctor suggested Novelon for three weeks. today she started taking the pill . But I have noticed that in the medicine booklet it has mentioned that persons using this pill often found to diagnose with breast cancer in future life. Sir, I want to know whether this pill is dangerous ?",
  "A": "Hi, Novelon is an oral contraceptive pill which contains both estrogen and progesterone(ethanol estradiol 0.03 mg, desogestrel 0.15 mg). It is having side effects like, Weight gain, Headache, dizziness, Nausea,Breast tenderness and enlargement, Cramping abdominal pain, Change in appetite, vomiting, Vaginal spotting etc. According to some studies oral contraceptives may cause estrogen dependent cancers like breast cancer. But the incidence is very low. That too if used for prolonged periods and higher doses. As this is low dose and with limit period of taking, no need to worry. Take care"
