  "A": "Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. You can conceive after treatment of the breast cancer. But you should not take external hormone therapy. You should try conceive naturally. External hormones can increase the risk of cancer recurrence. Consult your doctor and plan accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health."
