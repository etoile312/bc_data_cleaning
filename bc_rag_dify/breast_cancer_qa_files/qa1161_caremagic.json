  "Q": "allergic to wasp stings got stung about 45 minutes ago on right hand.  Have lymphedema in that arm from positive lymph node identified during breast cancer surgery 2009.  What should I be aware of?  apprx 1995 stung on same side of hand and had to go to emergency room.  Site is swelling and itching.  What should I do?",
  "A": "Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor, You can wash with baking soda which neutralize the acid content released by wasp. Cleaning underwater helps in washing out the content. All you have to do is take an in tetanus toxic injection and antihistamines like cetirizine and painkiller like paracetamol if pain is there. Visit the emergency room if you develop any of the following symptoms.-severe itching/pain-rashes all over the body -if you are not sure that stinger is out. Thank you."
