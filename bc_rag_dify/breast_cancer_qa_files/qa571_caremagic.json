  "Q": "How long can someone live with untreated jaundice?  My husband is jaundiced and his bili is still going up.  The other enzymes went down a little.  His itching is horrible.  His CT scans and MRI were normal.  Our docs are still looking for the cause and so far havent found anything and so are not treating anything.  My husband  neither drinks nor does drugs.",
  "A": "HelloWelcome to Chat Doctor It depends upon what is the cause of his jaundice. If it is infectious viral hepatitis, that caused by hepatitis or E virus resolves by themselves in 2-3 weeks. If it is Hepatitis B, C or D, it is chronic infection. Has his IGM HBS Ag levels been checked? If no, you need to go for it. It may require chronic treatment with interferon and Bavaria Chat Doctor. It can be because of blood disorders. I advise you to also get his blood smear and blood mammogram done. If anything found abnormal, further follow up can be done by a hematologist. Is his CT Aldo done?CT and MRI if normal rules out obstructive cause of jaundice. I advise him to refrain from unprotected sex, blood transfusion, sharing of needles. Hope I answered your query."
