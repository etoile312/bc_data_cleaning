  "Q": "I just had a regular mammogram yesterday and got a call today that a small nodule was found on the left side, and they wanted an ultrasound done. I will go a wk from today...should I be worried about cancer or a biopsy or what should I expect?Thank you !",
  "A": "A nodule in the breast seen on mammogram is always a worrisome thing, and it needs to be ascertained whether it is cancer. After the radiologist has done a USG, he will give an impression whether it appears cancerous to him or not on ammo+USG. If he categorically says it is benign, then you need not worry and just keep it under surveillance in the subsequent mammograms. If there is any doubt of cancer, then it needs to be biopsied and preferably removed surgically."
