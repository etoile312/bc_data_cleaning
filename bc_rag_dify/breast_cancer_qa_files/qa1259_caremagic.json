  "A": "Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern.  She has metastatic brain tumor from carcinoma of breast.  So it is stage 4 cancer.  Chemotherapy and radiotherapy is the treatment of choice.  Despite treatment prognosis remains poor. Life expectancy is just few months.  Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health."
