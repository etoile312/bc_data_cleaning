  "Q": "hello, I am worried cause I found a lump under my left breast and it cause localize pain like a pinch, also pain on the right side of my left breast  and the left side of my right breast. I have inverted nipples but this is  since I was born. I dont have   any discharge and I dont have any lump or swollen under my armpit.  I notice the pain if Im sitting or lying down but didnt weh nIm moving around or walking.",
  "A": "Hello! Thank you for the query. If the lump is not connected with your breast, most likely its benign skin lesion like lipoma or sebaceous cyst. Breasts pain can be caused by some hormonal changes, pregnancy, infection or in some case a tumor. Even if you are unable to palpate anything, you should have an ultrasound of your breasts done as well as lump under the breast ultrasound. Hope this will help. Regards."
