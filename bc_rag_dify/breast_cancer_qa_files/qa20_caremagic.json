  "Q": "Hi around 6 weeks ago I went and had a mammogram for a lump around an inch long the results came back that it was glandular tissue, but I ve noticed the past few days that it has either moved across my breast or has grown and I ve also found a small lump under my nipple and what looks like red veins on the surface of my breast where the glandular has either grown or moved what should I do.",
  "A": "Hi.based from your description, it could possibly be an inflammatory reaction or any of those breast lesions. It could be a cyst, a fibrous (fibrous tissue formation) or fibrotic changes of the breast, which are all benign breast lesions. Malignancy must also be ruled-out. It is best if you consult with a doctor, preferably a general surgeon, for clinical evaluation. Diagnostics such as breast ultrasound and mammography may be recommended. Management (medical and/or surgical) will be directed accordingly. Hope this helps. Good day!!~ Chat Doctor. "
