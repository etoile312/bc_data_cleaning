  "Q": "Hello Doctor,My wife is 33 years old. She has gone thru severe armpit pain about 5 months ago. Our family physician had given her a couple of pain killers which actually subsided the pain. Im now quite worried because the pain has reoocured after these many days. The Doc says that this pain is occuring due to swollen lymph nodes. She feels the pain most while driving a two wheeler or while crossing a road bump etc.Please advise. Kind regards..",
  "A": "Pain can occur under your arm for a number of reasons1. Certain infections can cause pain under the arm, Lymphangitis is caused by an acute streptococcal infection of the skin that infects the lymph node ducts, and many of these ducts exist under the arm. This can cause pain Other infections, such as skin abscesses, can cause lumps to form under the arm that are painful. Hair follicles can become infected, and a large lesion can develop. Sometimes these abscesses require Chat Doctor. 2. Lumps under the armpit are often painful, and they have several causes. Cancer, such as Hodgkin's lymphoma and metastasized breast cancer, can cause a painful lump to form in the armpit suggestions If the lump is due to infection caused by bacteria, it should go away with a course of antibiotics in few cases, an extremely painful knot under the armpit may need to be surgically removed. Hope this is helpful"
