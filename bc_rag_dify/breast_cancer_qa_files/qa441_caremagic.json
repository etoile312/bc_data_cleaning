  "Q": "i have a sliding hernia and c.o.p.d also high blood pressure and high colestrol in addition to angina and 13 years ago i had a mastectomy . next wednesday i will have a pre assessment before having my gall bladder removed by keyhole surgery. my main concern is will i be ok having this op with copd and my hernia problem. Has anyone undergone this surgery before with these problems. Thank you.",
  "A": "Hi. Thanks for the query. You didn't mention the indication for removal of your Gall bladder. Even though you are having gall stones, if you are not having pain in the right upper part of the abdomen, there is no need for surgery. It can be incidental Gall stone. As you are going for keyhole surgery(Laparoscopy), you will be given General anesthesia. Your anesthetist should be very competent to give Anesthesia to a COPD patient. Sliding hernia is not a contra indication for keyhole surgery. High blood pressure will be controlled by antihypertensives. Cholesterol levels will also be controlled. Everything will be assessed in your Pre assessment. If you are fit for surgery, you can ask your surgeon to do Sliding hernia also in the same set-up through keyhole method. As there is no medical treatment for Sliding hernia, you can ask your surgeon to do both procedures in single setting. I have done Gall bladder removal surgery with COPD without any complication in OPEN method, not by keyhole procedure. Hope you will be fit for Keyhole surgeryWish you good health. Regards"
