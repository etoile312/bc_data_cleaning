  "Q": "A mass appeared at my clavicle in May or June of 2013  in conjuction with an inflammatory breast cancer scare.My breast was pretty-much back to normal when I noticed this mass except that I was told the next day by a doctor that I could have this cancer (inflammatory breast cancer).   I went to specialists in June and had tests (mris, a ct scan, and an ultrasound).  One thoracic doctor wanted to remove part of my bone and replace it with a metal piece.  (He  did not have the ultrasound results which showed no place to biopsy on my breast and was not sure  I didnt have breast cancer.)    He gave me a recomended specialist when I asked for a second opinion;  I havent gone to him yet.  I  called back the breast surgeon.  More tests pursued in September (mris and a needle-guided biopsy).    Mayo Clinic was even involved.  No cancer was detected.  The bump had seemed to be getting smaller at the time of the tests and was not even bothering me in part of  October 2013.  In October I helped to paint a fence and was close to/or on the ground where the ground was muddy with water on top.  I had noticed just before that time that overdoing and stress seemed to bother me there.  I wondered if moist soil in Texas had anything to do with my problem as in May/June I had a respiratory illness before I went out and painted a fence and worked a little bit around turkey mulch.  Christmas Day I came home with a cold.  My clavicle bothers me now---more at night and if I have overdone.  I went to th primary care physician onTuesday and I had almost a 102 degree temperature.  My temperature was lower when I took it at home with a mercury thermometer.  I am now takinf cephalexin(500mg.) 4 times a day for 10 days.  If that doesnt do it, I will be going to the thoracic specialist I didnt go to earlier for a second opinion.  Wht do you think I should do?  Could I have a bone infection?  Test(s) seemed to show messed up bone.  E-mail address:   YYYY@YYYY",
  "A": "Hello dear, thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your situation and problem. In my opinion, with the history of inflammatory breast cancer in the past, your current curricular bone swelling should be investigated thoroughly for bone metastasis (spread of breast cancer in bone). So better to get done fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) from the bone swelling to diagnose it.FNAC will also be useful If it is bone infection. So better to get done FNAC and first diagnose the swelling and then start appropriate treatment."
