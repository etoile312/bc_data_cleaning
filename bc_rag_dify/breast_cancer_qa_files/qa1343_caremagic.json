  "Q": "Hi my mum was diag. with breast cancer 4 years ago and on every check up, she was told everything was fine a year and a half ago the scans had no sign of cancer, 3 weeks ago she had more scans and now the cancer is in her bones and lung, my mum is 81 years old. now she is on medication AROMASIN, I would like to know how affective is this medication, we were told 75 cent, does that mean to stop the cancer from spreading or eventually cure her, we would like to go and get another opinion , what do you think. My sister died of pancreatic cancer 6 years ago and I know how much she suffered, I would like to know shouldn t my mum have radiotherapy, thank you",
  "A": "Firstly, there is no role of radiotherapy except if the bony metastases are painful (to reduce the pain). Secondly, at her age and stage (stage 4), it is impossible to cure the disease. The aim now should be to prolong her life and keep her comfortable. For this aroma sin is a good option as it is well tolerated and keeps the disease under control. It does not cure the disease. Other options include chemotherapy which she is unlikely to tolerate."
