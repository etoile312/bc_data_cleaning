  "Q": "Hi, I am a 62 year old female, 165 pound that had breast cancer with chemo/radiation/masectomy.   2 years later a stem cell transplant for MDS.   My doctor tells me today that my kidneys are functioning 45-50% and my kidneys are equivalent to an 80 year old.   What am I to do?   I am on Crestor, Paxil, Xalatan and Vitamin D3 and Caltrate 600.",
  "A": "Hello and welcome to Chat Doctor.  As a Urologist, i can understand your anxiety.You've not written how long back you had the stem cell transplant. Also, which report showed the kidney function at 50%. An isotope scan or a contrast CT scan (CENT),should've have been done. Your blood creatinine, urea,electrolytes, RBS,LFT and platelets are tested. This change doesn't occur over a few days. It's gradually progressive. If needed, a kidney biopsy is done to find out cause for decreased function. Send the reports to me, as a direct question, for an expert opinion. Chat Doctor.  Manga."
