  "Q": "Hello about one month ago I felt a lump in my left breast. I felt it about a week or so before my period so I thought maybe its because of my period. After my period it decreaed a little but its still there. I shoyld also let you know that about a year ago my right breast was hurting terrible and hurts whenever I m closed to my period. I visited my doctor and after doing various test he said that I had benign breast cancer but not to worry about it. I do drink a lot of green tead because I noticed whenever I drink it the pain in my right breast seem to disappear after a while. I will however like you to tell me what you think about the lump in my left breast. Added to that the partition where my left breast separates from my right hurts a litttle whever I pass my figures there. Can u please help me Thank you very much",
  "A": "Hi.1. What you are having (I would not use the term suffering from) is called benign modularity. This is a common problem having a hormonal basis and there is nothing to worry about. 2. Now I will tell you the way to feel your own breasts to confirm benign modularity. If you pick up the breast between the fingers, you will feel a big firm mass (even normally). And if you feel the breast with the flat surface of pulp of your fingers with gentle rotating movements, you will not feel that firm mass which you felt earlier; instead you will perceive a granular feel (similar to the feel of a gunny bag filled with grains like rice for example). The granular feel suggests benign modularity. 3. Remember while feeling the breast with the flat surface of pulp of your fingers if you feel a firm or a hard mass (irrespective of its size), then it is a cause for concern, and you must consult a surgeon at the earliest. 4. Regarding pain overlying the breast-bone, well, it has nothing to do with the breasts. Such pain is usually self-limiting though it may take some time (maybe months) to disappear. Try some simple symptomatic treatment like local application of a little Index (or any other similar ointment) followed by hot fomentation. In short, at present, you have nothing to worry about. Thanks."
