  "Q": "i have a 10 cm posterior subserosal fiberiod and am 5-6 weeks pregant. the ultrasound shows that the baby sac is pressed against the fiberooid and sac is elongated... i am worried about potential of miscarridge or abnormal growth please advise thanks",
  "A": "Hello, I have gone through your query. While the submucous fibroid carry the maximum risk of causing an abortion, secondary to the submucous variety, subaerial fibroid are rare to cause complications in pregnancy unless they are large enough. If you have a introverted uterus and hence the posterior fibroid is pressing on the growing uterus, postural treatment can be somewhat helpful. If the sac is getting distorted as has been shown in your case, mastectomy may have to be contemplated to save the pregnancy. This should be managed in expert hands so as not to disturb the existing pregnancy. Uterine artery embolization may not be suggested in view of an active pregnancy. Hope you find this information helpful. Take care."
