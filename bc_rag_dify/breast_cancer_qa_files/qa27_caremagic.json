  "Q": "Hi Dr. Rynne, Good day. I am female, 23 years of age.Last 2009 I found out I have breast cyst but I did not consult a doctor (no enough money). I just treat it with a herbal plant which is mayana leaf because there was someone told me so. Does that plant can heal my cyst? Or should I take MX3 because I saw on tv it can cure cyst. Hope you can response on my concern. Because until this time I still have a cyst. Thank you & God Bless, Windy",
  "A": "Hi.noted history of breast cysts. It is best if you consult with a doctor, preferably a general surgeon, for physical examination and clinical evaluation. Breast cysts should be monitored regularly. Some of these lesions, grow, spontaneously resolved, and some are just there. Do you have a history of breast cancer or concerns in your family? Breast ultrasound will be requested as an additional tool for evaluation. Depending on the findings, if a tissue diagnosis will be recommended or just a regular follow-up/monitoring will do. Occasional breast pain/tenderness/discomfort, resolving spontaneously, is usually associated with these breast cysts especially during hormonal changes (such as before and during menstruation). Hope this helps. Good day!!~ Chat Doctor. "
