  "Q": "I am a 37 yo female with a past history of stage 3 breast cancer. I completed 6 rounds of chemo last year in May. I had 26 radiation treatments ending in September. At my checkup in January my WBC was low but my oncologist chalked it up to a cold I was fighting. Three months later, my WBC is still low. I am not fighting a cold so what could be the cause?",
  "A": "Hi, dear. I have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. Your WBC is low. There are many causes of low WBC count. Even simple viral infection, malaria, typhoid can cause low WBC count.  However, you have persistent low WBC count. So we have to think about some other causes.  You have taken radiation and chemotherapy.  So maybe it causes your bone marrow suppression and have low count.  Or there may be some other cause.  So if you have very low WBC count you should go for bone marrow examination once. It will give you exact idea regarding cause.  Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health."
