  "Q": "Hi. I m female, 40, had surgery and was treated with radiation for a 2.5 cm ductal carcinoma with micro mets last year through the end of November. I ve started working out again over the last 3 weeks. About one week ago, I noticed pain in my upper abdomen, about an inch below the juncture for my ribs. Sometimes, I just randomly feel pain, and always I feel it if I arch my back a little. This morning I noticed that I have a lump there. It feels like a nodule resting on top of a vein. It also hurts if I lightly rub down on the nodule. I m not sure if I should go to which doctor... I have a lot right now.",
  "A": "Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. You have history of ductal carcinoma of breast.  You may have soft tissue tumor like lipoma, neurofibroma, dermatofibroma or metastatic breast cancer.  Furthermore, you should go for ultrasound examination and if needed to go for fine needle aspiration cytology or biopsy of that lump. It will give you exact diagnosis. Then you should take treatment accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health."
