  "A": "Hello, Thanks for your query. I would come up with these possibilities for this blood with cough, This includes.1 As there is a long history of smoking, so may be due to cancer of lungs. Diagnosis can be confirmed by X-ray chest and M R I of lungs.2 Tuberculosis, diagnosis can be confirmed by X-ray chest and sputum (mucus) examination with blood examination.3 Gingivitis or pyorrhea, diagnosis can be confirmed by physical examination by an E N T specialist .4 Bleeding disorder is one of the most prominent causes, but in your case this is the least possible reason. Visit the dentist first for check up and your problem continue then go for complete mammogram .and them consult physician. I do hope that you have found something helpful, and I will be glad to answer any further query. Take care"
