  "Q": "I am 30 years old & have just checked my breasts for lumps & they seem to be fine. However I have just noticed a purple coloured mole/freckle on my right breast ??? It was not there before & I am a little concerned as I have never had a purple mole before & I no I defiantly didn t have a mole of any colour there before",
  "A": "Hi.it is best if you consult with a doctor for physical examination and clinical evaluation regarding your concern. A mole could be benign, but others have the tendency to be malignant. Physical examination and a possible biopsy, if needed, will be of great help. To rule any breast lesions for your age, a breast ultrasound is suggested. If there are lesions found, a consult with a general surgeon is best for evaluation and interpretation of results. Other diagnostics and management (medical and/or surgical) will be directed accordingly. Hope this helps. Good day!!~ Chat Doctor. "
