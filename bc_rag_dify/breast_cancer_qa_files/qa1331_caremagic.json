  "Q": "Hi, I am a 30 old male, weight 62 kg. Almost 4 years back i had physical contact with a foreigner. She says shes healthy and she does regular checkups. Now, few months back, i had a sudden itching problem in the groin area. I did try cleaning the area and applying powder etc but it didnt work. Then i tried the anti fungal, anti bacterial cream and it seemed to work. The itching disappeared and the skin went back almost to the normal state. But after 2-3 days i noticed that the white dry patches had replace the itching areas. I still apply the cream. But these days a red ring has appeared. What do i do? Help please.",
  "A": "Hello, Welcome to ChatDoctorI would keep a possibility of fungal infection/Tina courts. This is because closely opposing body folds e.g. finger webs, thighs and groin, maxilla, submammary folds etc. can trap sweat, heat and moisture, therefore making the area favorable for fungal proliferation. If I was the treating doctor I would have asked you to use a topical antifungal like clotrimazole cream, twice daily, regularly for 4 weeks. I would suggest you to take Oral antifungal e.g. oral terminating once daily for 4-6 weeks for a more complete urban OTC antihistamine e.g. cetirizine 10Â mg once daily would help you in symptomatic itch relief. Keeping the folds Chat Doctor. Thank you."
