  "Q": "My sister just had stage 2 breast cancer and had mastectomy and chemo last yr. Now, she had been coughing several days not relieved by breathing tx and antibiotics. Her chest xray showed suspicious densities in right upper lobe. She is not loosing wt and is on heavy side. She is worried it might be lung mets.",
  "A": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. In my opinion two possibilities can be thought of.1. Infection2. Metastasis. Lung Infections are common after chemotherapy as chemotherapy makes patient immunosuppressive and more prone to infection. Lung met scan also cause similar appearance. So better to get done CT Thorax first. As this will give you more idea about the appearance of the lesion. And if needed biopsy should be done. So consult pulmonologist and discuss all these."
