  "Q": "yesterday I noticed some soreness in my l breast. on further looking there is about 1 inch lump with redness.today it seems larger and itches. I am 67 yrs old. this is not a lump you have to mash to feel it can be felt by lightly running my fingers across This. And this is the week end so I am experiencing anxiety as to if it could be breast cancer.",
  "A": "Hello and welcome to Chat Doctor, Soreness in breast along with lump does not necessarily suggest breast cancer. An aspiration cytology is required for the breast lump. In aspiration cytology, cells are aspirated using a needle, spread on a glass slide and stained with appropriate stain. The nature and character of the lesion is determined by examining the cells under the microscope. In addition, other investigations like mammography is also required. Soreness of breast is more in favor of non-neoplastic lesion like fibroadenomas. Fibroadenosis is a condition wherein there is soreness and pain in breasts especially during menstruation. An irregular lump may also be present in the breasts. Thanks and take care Chat Doctor. "
