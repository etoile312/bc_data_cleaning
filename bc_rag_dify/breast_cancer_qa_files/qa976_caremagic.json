  "Q": "hi, my mother has a lump in herleft breast...she consulted a doctor or two they both diagnosed her and the results were negative of cancerits been year now and the breat has started to heal but she has this weird skin disease which no doctors here inpakistan know aboutis it some kind of symptom of breast cancer?",
  "A": "HI, Welcome with your query to Chat Doctor. Based on the facts of your query, you need treatment for Fibroadenomas, as it has lately shown regression/reduction in size.Don't think the skin lesion your mother had any connection with the Fibroadenomas, which is Hormonal Imbalance condition. When your doctors who examined it, dont feel it to be a Breast Cancer. As you are obsessed with it being Cancer-I would suggest you to have FNAC Biopsy under mammography guidance.Don't worry till the HPR biopsy report comes. Welcome for any further query in this regard Will appreciate writing your feedback review comments, to help the needy patients like you at Chat Doctor. Good Day!! Chat Doctor. S. Genl-CVTS"
