  "Q": "I had an oophorectomy 2 weeks ago.  I have developed a breakout on my scalp. red bumps on several different spots on my head since surgery.  I also, typically, have a breakout on my face after surgery.  I also had a lumpectomy on my right breast and bilateral breast reconstruction on Sept. 19.  I am almost done with radiation, I did not undergo chemotherapy.",
  "A": "Hi, Thanks for writing in. It is possible that you might have developed allergy to any medicine or Chat Doctor.  There is no obvious connection between rashes on the scalp and oophorectomy or breast lump surgery. You might have got the procedures done under anesthesia and taken cover of antibiotic and pain relief medicines. It is difficult to point out the exact cause unless it is clear that you have been having the symptoms right after using or taking a particular medicine. Please do not worry."
