  "Q": "Hello. I am a 19 year old male. In past 3 years sometimes i have had problems in breathing. I used to get a little pain in chest while bteathing inside. I used to give a pause and then breathe again slowly and it used to get okay. My chest size is little large and i am a little obese. From last 2 days i got an armpit lump that is not very big and not very swollen and is red in color. I felt weakness in fingers of both my hands today and feeling little weak today overall. I feel good after using neosporin powder in armpit iver lump. I dont know if its just a bacterial infection and gynomaetecia or im suffering from some type of cancer like lymphoma or male breast cancer.....",
  "A": "Hello, Thanks for the query to Chat Doctor. Forum. Since you are feeling difficulty in breathing form last three years. So first consult a physician and get in blood and X-ray (chest) to rule out any disease in lungs or not. You mentioned that size of your chest is somewhat large and obesity is also present. Your age is 19 years and obesity is common and due to this obesity size of chest may look large. Before making any diagnosis himself consult a doctor and let him decide what is wrong. Enlargement of lymph node at these 19 years age may be due to acute infection in the Chat Doctor. So please get in blood for sugar examination, because of, obesity,pyoderma (inflammation of lymph node)breathlessnessNumbness in fingers. Good luck."
