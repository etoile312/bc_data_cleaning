  "A": "HI, Welcome with your query to Chat Doctor. Based on the facts of your query, as You had positive family history for Cancer breast, It is but natural for you to have worry about your tender breast with armpit lump. In the context of this background, your armpit lump appears to be a Fibroadenomas of the Axillary Tail of the Breast. I would suggest you to get the Surgeons opinion and FNAC Biopsy with Homeopath study in your case, before being labelling it as a Cancer of Breast. In my opinion this lump in the breast appears to be Fibroadenomas, as its tender and may be due to nearing menses. If not, Check up with Mammography with 2-3 follow-ups and HPR Biopsy of the Breast with armpit Lump Biopsy would resolve the fear accompanied by your breast and armpit lumps. Remedy-After proper follow up and investigation from Surgeon, if cancer is confirmed by Homeopath study report, then Onco-Surgeon needs to be consulted, who would plan the needful treatment accordingly. If it's a benign one in both the breast and armpit lump, regular physical examination with palm of your hand and by Mammography followup 3-6 they, would resolve the treatment issue in your case. In my Opinion you should not worry till you get the final Homeopath report after FNAC Biopsy of breast /and armpit lumps. Will appreciate writing your feedback review comments, to help the needy patients like you at Chat Doctor. Good Day!! Chat Doctor. S. Genl-CVTS"
