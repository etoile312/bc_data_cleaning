  "Q": "i have been having a small painless lump behind ear for 9 months now. At times its gets bigger and at times it gets smaller. I suffer from sinus almost everyday which affect my throat and ear and I was wondering if could that be the cause or is it cancer?,i lost my mom of breast cancer. Im a female and 25years old",
  "A": "Hi. Thanks for your query and an elucidated history. This can not be a cancer as it would have grown phenomenally within 9 months. And this is never the site of any cancer. So please do not worry. This is most probably a small innocuous lymph node, you can confirm this by FNAC- fine needle aspiration cytology. This usually needs no treatment unless shows - redness, increase in size or pain. You do not have so anything to worry."
