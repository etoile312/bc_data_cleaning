  "Q": "Hi... Im due for BA surgery next Friday.... I have come down with a severe chest infection. Im on antibiotics and I feel its clearing... I have fevers and everything really bad last Thursday and Friday, but Im wondering if this clears before Friday would they still choose to postpone?",
  "A": "Thanks for your query at Chat Doctor! Yes it is likely that they may postpone the surgery for your breast augmentation. I suggest first get treated for your infection. Its good you are responding to antibiotics, so there is no need to change them. Monitor your fever constantly. You can get tested for blood culture & sensitivity(aerobic/anaerobic) if fever persists. Get you sputum tested for gram stain & culture & sensitivity(aerobic/anaerobic) if fever persists. Get your complete mammogram done with chest X-ray. Investigations will help to reach etiological diagnosis, but most of such cases are due to viruses (Rhinovirus, influenza, para influenza, etc.) which are self limiting. You will have to take antibiotics to prevent secondary infections, bronchodilators, cough suppressants, anti-inflammatory and analgesics for which you can visit your general practitioner or a pulmonologist.1.  Chat Doctor. 2. Get plenty of rest to help your body recover.3. If you smoke, stop. Take care!"
