  "Q": "My son (30 yrs old) is in Calif on business currently; lives in Michigan. He s been having a headache and fever up to 103* and he has this round thing on the inside of his arm that looks (to me) like a tick or spider bite. In Michigan, we have lots of ticks and they can cause some really scary diseases. He went to a clinic in CA and the doctor told him to get some rest and take Advil. He s very lethargic. I don t usually get involved in my adult kids business, but this could be serious and I m very worried.",
  "A": "HiT hanks for your query at Chat Doctor. I understand your concern and situation. I would advise you not to worry so much as the doctor might have evaluated the patient. You must give him paracetamol or Advil, tepid sponging and if itching then cetirizine. Monitor temperature. Get routine mammogram and serological test for tick borne fever. Depending upon the results antibiotics may be started. Hope I answered your query Chat Doctor. "
