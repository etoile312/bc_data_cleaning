  "A": "Hi Dear, Welcome to Chat Doctor. Understanding your concern. As per your query you have pain on the left side of the breast. Well there can be many reasons for symptoms you mention in query like lymph node swelling, breast cancer, localize infection, broken rib or angina. I would suggest you to consult doctor, who may order mammogram, blood test or chest x-ray. Doctor may prescribe antibiotics at least for 5 days, along with anti-inflammatory. Doctor may recommend radiotherapy. Doctor may refer you to orthopedic surgeon for proper examination for broken rib. For now take rest and apply warm compresses to pain site.
