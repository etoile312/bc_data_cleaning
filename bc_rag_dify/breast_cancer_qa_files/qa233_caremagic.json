  "Q": "hey, i just have a few symptoms im concerned about, im 22years old and have one child, first concern is i had been on the depo injection for 3years i stopped and last injection was in october last year (2012) it is now june (2013) and i havent been on any other contraceptive and i still havent had a period, but i have had white discharge since i havent been on it aswell. Second concern is my breast have been very tender and sore (i have taken pregnancy tests and all come back negative). on my areola i have got a pimple like lump its red and white discharge keeps coming out of it aswell. For about 2-3weeks my breasts had swollen up a cup size and were full and heavier but have now gone back down. Any answer to my concerns please?? Thanks.",
  "A": "Hi I am Chat Doctor of all you should know that prolonged use of oral contraceptives can alter the hormonal mechanisms and periods are controlled by hormones. If you are breastfeeding then periods can be delayed. Also have an ultrasound done to look into uterine status and get a blood pregnancy test. If all negative consult a gynecologist which can prescribe medicines to start periods, thanks. Breast tenderness is generally due to hormonal irregularities as well. Thanks"
