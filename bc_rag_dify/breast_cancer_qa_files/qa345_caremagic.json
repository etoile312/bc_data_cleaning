  "Q": "Good evening.just recently had phyllodes tumors removed.soon after received pathology report, it indicated that the tumors would best fit in the borderline category.and that a simple mastectomy was recommended.I would just like an opinion of what should have been my next step?",
  "A": "Hello. Phylloides tumor is mostly a benign tumor.you don't need to worry much wide local excision along with biopsy of tissue is the mainstay of treatment.which is already done in your case. Borderline means it Is not harmful tumor. Survival rates for this is very, very good. What you need to do is just follow healthy lifestyle.avoid smoking and other carcinogens. Keep in touch with your doctor. If you have any suspicion contact doctor immediately. If you have any more questions message me. I would be happy to help you."
