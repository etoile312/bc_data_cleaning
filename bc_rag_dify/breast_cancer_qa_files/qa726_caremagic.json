  "Q": "I sometimes when I am exercising, especially touching toes or sit-ups, I feel something pull and it feels like a lump that pops out just below my breast but its in my very upper chest area. I can feel it and I can put it  back in but its still sore for a bit afterwards. I cant feel anythng normally but only if I stretch funny or am doing exercises. Any ideas?",
  "A": "Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. You may have small breast lump.  It can be due to some benign cyst, proliferative breast lesion like fibroadenoma or fibroadenomas, breast cancer or other lump.  You should go for mammography and biopsy of that lump. It will give you exact diagnosis. Then you should take treatment accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health."
