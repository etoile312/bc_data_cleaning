  "A": "Hello, Nipple discharge is almost always a sign that something else is going on that is causing it.  Men who are going through puberty may experience nipple discharge because of the changing hormone levels in their bodies. Squeezing and manipulating the nipples can cause discharge to happen more frequently.  Breast infections are most common in women who are breastfeeding, but men can develop them too. There are some other conditions too. But nothing to worry. Consult a doctor for physical examination. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Take care Chat Doctor.
