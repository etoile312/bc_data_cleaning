  "Q": "A friend of mine was diagnosed with secondary bone cancer nearly 3 years ago.  she had a grade 3 tumour removed from her breast. Her bones seem to be getting worse, she is in hospital at the moment having had a hip replacement op due to the cancer.  she is also having radiotherapy at the moment for spots on her brain.  we have been so worried for the last 3 years and still dont know really whats ahead - we would like some honest answers so we can prepare",
  "A": "Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. She has breast cancer grade 3 with multiple bone metastasis.  Tobit is stage 4 cancer.  It is last stage of disease.  She also has brain metastasis. So only treatment options are chemotherapy and radiotherapy as well as symptomatic treatment.  No treatment will cure the disease. Despite any treatment prognosis remains poor.  Life expectancy is not good.  Sorry to say but it is fact.  So you should plan accordingly. In my opinion no treatment should be given. Only asymptomatic treatment is given. You should consult your oncologist and plan accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health."
