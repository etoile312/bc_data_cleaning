  "A": "Dear patient Its true that at 16 years of age you do not get breast cancer. Lymph node at back of neck may be due to scalp infection or local throat infection and is common in young age. Best thing is to get excision biopsy done. In this procedure involved lymph node is removed under local anesthesia and sent for histopathology examination.  It gives correct diagnosis and also removes painful lymph node. All the best."
