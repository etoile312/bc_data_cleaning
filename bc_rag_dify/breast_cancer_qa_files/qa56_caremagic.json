  "A": "Welcome to Chat Doctor I am Chat Doctor and I will help you with your problem have gone through your question. You have a swelling in the armpit, and you are worried that It might be Breast or any other carcinoma. I need answers to few questions as required always to understand the problem in better way-Exact site of the lump?- How you first noticed it?- How it bothers you?- Is its fix or mobile?- Can skin be pinched over it?- How is the consistency of the lump? Whether its soft/ firm /hard? With available information and when screening for breast Ca is negative. This swelling can most likely be Lipomafollowed by Lymph node enlargement and sebaceous cyst. Ultrasonography can play an important role in differentiating between these. Small lipoma and sebaceous cyst need no intervention while lymph node enlargement need a cause, which should be looked far. Excisional biopsy followed by histopathology of the removed specimen; will end all suspicions and give us tissue diagnosis. I hope my answer will help you. Do rate it, if you like it. Regards"
