  "Q": "I have the mirena iud, had it over 9 months now. I got a period at first but as months went on it seemed to go away, only maybe getting a very lite one every two months. All of a sudden my breast were feeling sore and swollen,followed by cramping and bloating. As what I thought might be my period coming on, still two almost 3 weeks since it started still no period. Have taken a few home pt and negative. The cramping has not gone away. I go tomorrow for blood test because im suppose to be getting my tubes tied next month. I just keep thinking Im pregnant. I just had a small thick order less snot mucus discharge. Does this mean I am pregnant?",
  "A": "Hi. Thanks for asking in Chat Doctor. Mirena IUD contains progesterone. It releases progesterone slowly for a period of 5 years. Amenorrhea (absence of period), bloating, breast tenderness and abdominal cramps are all due to the progesterone released from IRENA. Absence of periods indicate that the progesterone level in your body is high and that may be the reason for the side effects. Though IRENA releases progesterone, it does not suppress the regular synthesis of progesterone from ovaries and that may be the reason for the elevated level of progesterone. With Chat Doctor.  Progesterone will prevent the implantation of fertilized ovum in the uterus. Also, an IUD serves as a foreign body in uterus and prevents pregnancy and so the chances of pregnancy are minimal with IRENA. You are anxious about conception because of absence of periods. Although the failure rate of IRENA is only 0.1 to 0.4%, it is better to rule out pregnancy through blood test as you have decided because that will relieve your anxiety. I hope this is useful to you."
