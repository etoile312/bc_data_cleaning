  "Q": "I was recently diagnosed with squamous cell T4 bladder cancer. I m a 62 year old male paraplegic, 175 lbs and never a smoker. I also never had an indwelling catheter. I had a radical cystectomy and ileal diversion. The pathology report stated that all of the tumor was removed and all of the lymph nodes removed were negative. There was however evidence of lymphovascular involvement. I have been recommended both a CGI or TIP chemo regimen. Which would be most effective. I have no evidence of metastisis.",
  "A": "Hello you have good postop report except one high risk factor. In case of bladder cancer advanced stage-post mastectomy high risk features are present adjuvant chemotherapy can give survival benefit. Both regimens are effective, but TIP is the more frequently used combination. Toxicity profile of both regimens is almost same as two regimens differ in only one Chat Doctor.  CGI can cause more decrease in blood cell count and TIP can cause more of nerve toxicity. Hope this answers your question."
