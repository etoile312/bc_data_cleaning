  "Q": "I am suffering from fever for last 10 days.Initial 7 days fever use to stay in night and go in morning. From last sunday I am taking antibiotic gudcef on doctors advise. This has reduced the intensity of fever. However I have two added problems now. Fever timing got changed; now I have mild fever (upto 100 F ) both in night and morning time. Also I cannot eat anything. My hunger sensation has died. Whenever I am eating I am vomitting. Today after vomit I found slight traces of blood in my spootum. Please advise as to what disease I am suffering and is this happening as side effect of antibiotic I am taking.Thanks Suvojit",
  "A": "Welcome to Chat Doctor. I Understand your concern. As per history given by you, you could be suffering from viral /bacterial infection or a combination of both. Antibiotic course given to you have taken care of the bacterial infection, and it has resulted in the intensity of fever going down, but it is not effective against viral infection. To confirm presence of viral infection you need to undergo mammogram with blood smear test. Along with it, you need to take rest, antipyretics like Cronin three times a day to keep fever in check. Follow up with the lab reports with local doctor. Thanks and regards. No need to worry. Viral infection subsides by its own."
