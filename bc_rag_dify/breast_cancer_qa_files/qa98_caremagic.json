  "Q": "Hi. i have a breast mass which i discovered more than  a year ago. Im afraid of surgery so i drink mx3 capsule. would it help remove the lump? last year i got pregnant and gave birth 2 months ago so i stop drinking mx3 but after i gave birth i found out that there are already 2 lumps in my breast, a new small mass was formed. would it possibly lead to cancer? is there any pill that will dissolve those lumps formed? what are the symptoms of breast cancer?",
