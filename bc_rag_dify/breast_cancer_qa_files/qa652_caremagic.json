  "Q": "I had a carotid body tumor removed in 2007. It was cancer. Currently have lession on gum (comes and goes), dentist can not determine if this is from tooth problem or sinsus. Is this possibly a spreadof orginal cancer.  Also had breast cancer L 1997and R 2003.",
  "A": "Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query. The lesion on gums can be a Paris or a myogenic granuloma or peripheral ossifying fibrous. Consult an oral physician and get it examined completely and get a radiograph done to rule out any tooth infection. If it is a tooth infection, it can be treated with RCT or extraction. If it is a myogenic granuloma or peripheral ossifying fibrous, then it can be surgically removed. The chances of spread of cancer to this region is less, but it can occur. Based on your description of the lesion, it is difficult to give a diagnosis and treatment plan, if you can upload the images of the lesion, we can give an exact diagnosis and treatment plan. I hope my answer will help you, take care."
