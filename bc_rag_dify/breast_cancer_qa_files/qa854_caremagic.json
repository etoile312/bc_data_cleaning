  "Q": "Hi, I m a 22 year old male 1.9m tall and weigh 110kg. I m experiencing a radiating pain on the left side of my chest, above my nipple, on the breast. It started of feeling like a muscular pain but know the pain has increased and affecting the whole top of my left breast. I worry if its possible an insect got onto my clothes from the clothes line and now into my breast. Is this at all possible ?",
  "A": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. Insect bites are possible in your case. These can cause infection, inflammation, cellulitis and abscess formation in breast tissue. All these cause severe pain in involved breast. So better to consult doctor and get done local breast examination and ultrasound examination of breast. If ultrasound is normal then no need to worry about breast diseases. Musculoskeletal pain can also cause similar symptoms. So avoid heavyweight lifting and strenuous exercise. Avoid movements causing pain. Avoid bad postures in sleep. Apply warm water pad on affected areas. Take painkiller and muscle relaxant Chat Doctor.  Don't worry, you will be alright, but first rule out breast diseases by ultrasound examination. Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health. Thanks."
