  "A": "Hello, No, an increase in the size of follicle indicates that the ovarian function to produce eggs is not occurring as it should. The endometrial thickness on day eleven at six mm is okay. You need further evaluation by FSH levels or AMH levels regarding your ovarian function. The FSH test is done on day two of the cycle. Also, I would like to know if your mastectomy was done laparoscopically or open. And if the uterine cavity was opened or not. As these could affect the pregnancy. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. "
