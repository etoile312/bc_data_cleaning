  "Q": "I am 47 years old and having chemo for breast cancer. I have had 2 of four sessions. I seem to have the worst tast in my mouth all the time. Even after I brush and rinse, as soon as my mouth starts to salivate it gets gross. Everything I eat or drink tasts gross. Is there good home remodies out there? I did try the salt and baking powder. That did not seem to help much. According to my doctor we got all the cancer, we caught it early and the chemo is to try not to get it back. My cancer was hormone receptive so they have taken me off my hormone pills I have been on for the last 6 years. So now I not only have a gross tast in my mouth I am hot and sweaty all the time.",
