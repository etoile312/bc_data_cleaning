  "Q": "Both my mother and I have had breast cancer - hers was in 1989 and mine in 2008. She had radiation. I had both chemo and radiation. She was diagnosed a 2nd time in 2008 in the other breast and since it was so small and her age she decided to just go on aromasin (exestame). Her mammo are now normal. I also was put on aromasin(exestame) after radiation. We have both been on the med for 6 years. We both have normal mammographies. Both of us have noticed that the right breast has shrunk - her considerably and mine not as much but it definitely it is quite smaller than originally after surgery. It is possible to be a side effect of the exestame? What are the consequences of stopping the med? Thank you Forget it - didn t know there was a charge for this!!!!!!!",
  "A": "Hi, Thanks for writing in. Exestame (aroma sin) causes side effects in about 10 percent of patients taking it. It is given to many patients and the treatment is acceptable.Some common side effects include the following hot flushesfatiguearthralgiaheadacheinsomnia increased sweating shrinking of breast is in response to radiation therapy and the breast might have undergone radiation therapy changes and this causes slight decrease in size of breast. Please do not worry."
