  "Q": "Hi, I am 16 years old, Five foot three, and weigh 125 pounds.  I exercise regularly.  The other day i was going for a run and I noticed I was quickly out of breath which isnt normal for me because I am an athlete.  My side was in a lot of pain.  When I got home I noticed that there is a large lump with a large amount of pain when I press upon it and also just in general right on my left rib cage, under my left breast.  There are no signs of breast cancer in my family. It hurts when I mover certain ways, exercise, laugh, and even breathe.  Also, it has made it harder for me to breathe in general.  I was wondering what this could be?",
