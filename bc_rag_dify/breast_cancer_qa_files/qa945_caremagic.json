How do I fix my problem. My face is broken out all over check and nose area. thanks",
  "A": "Hi dear, As you mention in query that you have been prescribed antiviral Chat Doctor.  It means the bumps are result of bacterial infection or body is showing reaction to certain medicine. I would suggest you to consult dermatologist again and your surgeon who placed implant to discuss the condition. Doctor may prescribe antibiotics like minocycline or clindamycin. Till the give cold compresses to the bumps, use mild soap to wash the face with cold water twice a day. Also apply atelier acid containing cream which is very effective for pimples. Avoid excessive sun exposure, cover your face while under sun exposure. Hope your concern has been resolved. Get Well Soon. Best Wishes,"
