  "Q": "I experience breathlessness without physical exertion, sore throat that worsens in the evening and often wake up with headache which remains inspite of taking paracetamol/iboprufen. I underwent chemo and radiotherapy for breast cancer six years ago and have had mild leucopenia since. My lungs are fine, having been tested for pulmonary fibrosis, but I have cold symptoms and cold shivers almost everyday.  Is this normal when the immune system has been affected?",
  "A": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. Yes, recurrent throat infections are common after chemo radio therapy because of immunosuppression. So oral hygiene (antiseptic mouth wash) is very important for this. For your breathlessness without exertion, you should definitely consult pulmonologist and get done PFT (Pulmonary Function Test) to rule out bronchitis. Bronchitis is very common after chemo radio therapy. If PFT is suggestive of obstructive defect then you will need inhaled bronchodilators (formoterol or albuterol) and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) (budesonide or fluticasone).Don't worry, you will be alright with all these. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks."
