YYYY@YYYY",
  "A": "Welcome to Chat Doctor ..... Since you got breast cancer at an early age of 41 years you may have a mutation in BRA causing it... But other factors like family history, associated cancers like ovary, colon or stomach are usually associated with BRA breast cancer, and it has an earlier age of onset at 35 years or so....If you would like to review with the above details then we can consider the need for BRA testing for your daughter"
