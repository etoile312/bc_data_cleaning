  "Q": "Today, I have a positive urine culture for Klebsiella Pneumonia. Have been on cipro for 3 days waiting for the results of the culture. I was also treated 3 weeks ago with augmentin for a post surigical wound infection after mastectomy. The wound is still not totally healed either. I m worried that these two infections may be related. My pcp wanted to send out macrobid for the uti, but wondering if Keflex would be better. I ve had a c.difficele infection in the past after multiple abx for uti two years ago, that weren t being treated properly, and Keflex worked well. So worried about several issues and asking for your opinion.",
  "A": "Hello, The antibiotics to treat urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by Klebsiella Pneumonia should be selected based on the culture and sensitivity testing report. Please send the culture report to me for further suggestions. Meanwhile, while you are under antibiotics, please take probiotics to stabilize intestinal flora to prevent any gut issues.  Chat Doctor.  Take cranberry supplement or tea. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.  "
