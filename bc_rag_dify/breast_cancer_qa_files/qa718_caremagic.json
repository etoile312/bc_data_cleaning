  "Q": "I had blood work 2 days after I got diverticulitis an it showed my Hgb went from 12.0 to 10.6. Also my C-Reactive Protein was 8.6. Just fiinished taking Cipro 500 twice daily and Flagyl 500 twice daily for seven days. My gastroenterologist said there was no blood in my stool on examination. I will have an endoscopy because of a history of gastric ulcers that haven t acted up in 3 years. I am also a 10 year survivor of stage 2 breast cancer. My last bloodwork was with my oncologist on July 16, 2014. Everthing was in range and I m still taking Arimidex, now 9 years.",
  "A": "Hi, Thanks for asking. Based on your query, my opinion is as follows.1. It appears to be possibly dilution anemia.2. Due to fluids being transfused during surgery, your RBC dilution could have caused it. Repetition after a week will possibly get the hemoglobin back to normal.3. Nutritional supplements are necessary to further improve hemoglobin levels. Hope it helps. Any further queries, happy to help again."
