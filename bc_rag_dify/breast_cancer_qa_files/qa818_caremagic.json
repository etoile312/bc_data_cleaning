I revisted doctor today and he told me to take antiboitic and it will be cured else some need of operation. Doctor he also asked do u eat tobacco in my mouth as he found some spots of it... i dont eat tobacco but yes i do eat pan masala... does that mean i do ahve symptoms of cancer ..",
  "A": "Hi, Thanks for query, Eating pan masala is one of the factor to develop cancer. This time you have middle ear infection may be due to infection. This is not cancer. You consult ENT .he will examine your ear & if he found any perforation he advised you accordingly for need of Tympanplasty or Mastectomy. This is not cancer but your habit of eating masala contains solar causes irritation may lead to you towards it. Thanks."
