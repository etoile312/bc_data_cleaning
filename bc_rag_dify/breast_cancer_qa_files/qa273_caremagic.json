  "Q": "I went to my family doc because I had painful lumps under my arms. She said they were swollen lymph nodes. I just had a bilateral axillary ultrasound and nothing was found. But they didn t do any breast images. I have absolutely no other symptoms. Still waiting for the CBC, should I have asked for more tests?",
  "A": "Hi.observation will do for now. If you had a recent infection, lymph nodes usually got inflamed, hence, those lymphadenopathies. They usually spontaneously resolved. If you have a strong family history of breast cancer/problems, you could opt for breast imaging now. Otherwise, you could opt just for breast ca screening at the age of 35 via mammography and ultrasound. Depending on the findings, management would follow accordingly. Hope this helps. Good day!!~ Chat Doctor. "
