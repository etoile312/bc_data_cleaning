  "Q": "My son 13 years old and is a black male. He has a small lump under his left nipple, and when he squeezes, white substance comes out. It doesnt him, but my mother-in-law thinks its serious and thinks we need to take him to a doctor? what should i do? i think as long as it is not hurting him and it doesnt leak when no pressure is applied, he will grow out of it?",
  "A": "Hi, Dear,thanks for the query to Chat Doctor. Dear, your sons lump is non-painful.Hence, it seems to be either a supernumerary nipple with pubertal breast changes(Polynesia)with white discharge on squeezing. Though this discharge may vanish as your son grows. But would need a plastic mastectomy for cosmetic confidence for your son, which would increase his self-confidence while growing Another possibility of such a lump is of Sebaceous Cyst, which will discharge white substance. There are other possibilities of such a lump but are theoretical and which your doctor would rule out after clinical examination.Hence, for your information the discharge doesn't seem to be pus discharge as it's not painful on squeezing. Your mother-in-law is right in her thinking, as In my opinion, in either of the possibilities as explained above, you need to show it to your doctor and consult for the confirmation of the possibilities and needful treatment.Don't worry and go ahead as suggested to resolve the lump issue of your son. Hope this would give you confidence to plan treatment with your doctor on your next visit, which you should plan definitely. Feel free to ask any further query in this regard to Chat Doctor and to ME. Write excellent review if you feel satisfied with this reply, which would help my rating for the benefit of the other patients. Wishing early and fast recovery for your son. Chat Doctor. N.
