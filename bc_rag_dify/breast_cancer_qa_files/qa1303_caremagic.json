  "Q": "Hello, a friend of mine is having a freak out because yesterday, her boyfriend ejaculated inside her, and they were not using proper protection. She took Plan B and is experiencing spotting and clotting in her urine . Is this a normal side effect of Plan B? Also, how long does it take for Plan B to work, what are signs that it is working?",
  "A": "Hi, Thanks for the query. The spotting she is having could be due to post-coital tear or could be a side effect of the emergency pill, as that can cause menstrual irregularities. The plan B to be taken within 72 hours of the act. Earlier you took the pill, the possibility of protection will be more. Experiencing symptoms like bloating sensation of the abdomen, breast tenderness etc. can indicate the effectiveness. But exact evidence is absence of pregnancy and resuming normal menstrual flow.
