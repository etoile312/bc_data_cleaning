  "A": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor.You're all symptoms like puckering, thickening, reddened areola are suggestive of malignancy mostly. And you are also having positive family history. Which makes you suspect for breast cancer. I advise you to get done1. PET SCAN 2. Biopsy from PET positive lesion.3. Get done ER (Estrogen Receptor) and PR (Progesterone Receptor) study from biopsy material. This will give you exact idea about you are having malignancy or not. If PET SCAN is negative than no need to worry much."
