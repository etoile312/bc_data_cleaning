  "A": "Hi, Thanks for writing in. Many patients get secondary bone metastasis from breast cancer that is treated even more than 5 years back. It is important to know which bone is affected and what is the extent of the bone lesion. Since she is elderly, it is important to provide her with adequate nutrition. A patient like your mother with post mastectomy and a bone spread might survive till 2 years after detection of the secondary bone cancer with good treatment and care. If she is not eating then the survival more than 6 months to a year is difficult. If she has deny Chat Doctor.  Eating is an important part of management and even if her appetite is reduced you should convince her to eat smaller meals at regular intervals every 3 to 4 hours. Please do not worry."
