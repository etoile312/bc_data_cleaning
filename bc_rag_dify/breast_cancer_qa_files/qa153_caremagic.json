  "Q": "My name is augustina I ve had a surgery for lump in my left breast which the doctor says is Fibroid Dyplesia 25years ago over the years a lump has grown on my back on the same left side the lump is not painful but in my body under the lump is paining a lot sometimes I cannot move my arm Can it be breast cancer or can the lump be operated on",
  "A": "HI, Welcome to Chat Doctor with your query. Confirm the diagnosis before the Treatment Planning-By the facts of your query, In my opinion, you seem to have infective lump? Boil/Sebaceous Cyst with reactivated infection in it, as it's paining under the lump. In such a situation, its very difficult to confirm its relation to the Fibrous Dysplasia removed 25 years back. But the chances are there of link to the Fibrous Dysplasia, as this lump in the back on left side could be a Secondary metastasis from an occult/hidden breast cancer in the left breast. Treatment-Antibiotics/anti-inflammatory treatment from your doctor, if responded would confirm the infective cause of it.Non-response would need Second opinion from Surgeon who would direct further treatment after proper examination and investigations, accordingly. But don't worry till this lump in the back is confirmed by biopsy as Cancerous and Could be treated by -Surgical Excision with Biopsy, which would confirm further treatment line. Hope this would help you to plan treatment with your doctor. Will appreciate hitting thanks and writing review comments to benefit needy patient visitors at Chat Doctor like you. Good day.
