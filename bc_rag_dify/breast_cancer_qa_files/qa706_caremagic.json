  "Q": "My daughter had a black surface lump under her breast. Now the black part is gone but there is a hole there, and she has now gotten the same thing in her arm pit. What are these? How does she get rid of them? And can she prevent them? The one under her breast hurts when her bra rubs it.",
  "A": "Hi, Dear,Thanks for the query to Chat Doctor. I studied your problem in depth and I understood your concerns. Cause and plan of Treatment-In my opinion on the given data, your daughter seem to have folliculitis below her breast with the black head. The hole in that lump lately is due mostly because of wash out of black head. The lump in the armpit could be Cellulitis with black head and is very much possible.Treatment-would be-Use the proper size bra-to avoid any friction-which has caused the boil under her breast. Antibiotics / anti-inflammatory for 5 days period would resolve the armpit and under breast painful lumps.Don't guess more. I would advise ER Surgeon Consultation to avoid further complications with it. Hope this would resolve your issues. Act fast. So keep cool and Consult your ER Surgeon, if need be, who would treat it accordingly.
