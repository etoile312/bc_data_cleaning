  "Q": "My daughter started with severe pain from armpit to wrist. Vein swelled. Bruising along entire vein line. Hand swollen. Went to ER. Did blood clot test and mammogram. Blot clot test negative. No results from mamogram yet. Any suggestions? She has Hashimotos and I am thinking it might be related to that.",
