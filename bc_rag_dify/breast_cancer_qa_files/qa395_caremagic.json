  "Q": "For a few months I have the sensation of a fullness of sorts under my arm. Sometimes feels like it s in my arm, other times it feels like on the side of by breast (recent mammogram was normal). Sometimes it feels like a pulsing or even a bit of a pain. No lumps are found.",
  "A": "HiT hanks for contacting Chat Doctor. I understand your concern. If no lump is there and mammogram is normal than you should not much worry. If still you have doubt in mind, you can consult surgeon. Pain and fullness around your arm might be due to muscle pain. For that you can try simple analgesics like Ibuprofen 400 mg 8 hourly. If you have trouble in raising hand, it might be frozen shoulder. You can consult physiotherapist for that. Thanks."
