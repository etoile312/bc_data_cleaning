  "Q": "I just noticed some redness on my upper arm, wondered if this could be celluitis? 26 nodes were removed in 2010 because breast cancer had spread into 14 of them. I was diagnosed with stage 3 estrogen receptor positive br. cancer in my left breast. I had carpal tunel surgery on my right hand on Dec.11. so I have probably overused my left arm. I put on the quilted Carisa sleeve tonight. Dont know for sure if I should wear it with possible cellulitis? I am also getting over some type of cold virus. Thanks for your time!",
  "A": "HI. It is difficult to say the real reason for swelling. To develop lymph-edema after 3 years of nodes surgery is difficult to say(although it can). Have you got a swelling with elevated local temperature? Any malaise, fever? Has it got a throbbing pain and pain on movement ? If yes - it can be cellulitis. I would advise consulting a Doctor urgently if this is the same arm where surgery of lymph node removal was taken, as the lymphatics are already less to work."
