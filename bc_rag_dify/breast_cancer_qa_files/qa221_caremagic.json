  "Q": "i have had my ovaries removed. Bilateral breast cancer and I have multi centric castle mans. all is suppose to be in remission. I have been swelling in my lower body....very much on my right side.....lower feet. Small pain in lower right grown area. I have began to have vaginal bleeding. Any thoughts?",
  "A": "It's important for me to know what medicines you are taking, your age, stage of your cancer and past history of treatment. Your vaginal bleeding raises suspicion of developing some problem in your uterus especially if you are taking or have taken tamoxifen(novae). This can also explain swelling in your lower body and pain in groin. I would recommend a complete gynecological examination as soon possible."
