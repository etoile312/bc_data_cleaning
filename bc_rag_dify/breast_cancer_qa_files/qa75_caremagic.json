  "A": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your situation and problem. If mammogram is clear and no evidence of lump than no need to worry much about breast cancer. Breast enlargement can be seen in hormonal imbalance or due to Chat Doctor. So better to consult gynecologist and get done hormonal study. If any abnormality is there, start its correction. I advise you to get done regular mammography annually to detect early breast cancer if at all developing as you had family history of breast cancer. But at present no need to worry about breast cancer."
