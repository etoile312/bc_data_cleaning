  "A": "Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor. Based on the information provided by you, the breast lump could be a Fibroadenoma or fibrotic disease. Fibroadenoma is benign swelling which moves freely with in the breast tissue and is usually pains and often requires no treatment. Fibrotic disease is usually seen in women in their 30s and present as a painful mass which does not move freely in breast tissue. It presents as pain during menstruation (Cyclical Nostalgia).  You have not mentioned anything about pain in the swelling during menstruation.  The possibility of fibrotic disease can be ruled out as you are 22 and you don't have any pain. So, the breast lump you have is a Fibroadenoma. FNAC does not remove the swelling. FNAC is a test where some sample of the lump is taken through the needle and tested to know what type of swelling. Evian Capsules contain vitamin E and you can take them without any doubt. You need no special precautions and just stop worrying.  Please get the FNAC done and if it turns out to be fibroadenoma, you do not need any surgery. Surgery in Fibroadenoma is required only when the lump is too big and causes mass effects. Hope you got my point. Take Care"
