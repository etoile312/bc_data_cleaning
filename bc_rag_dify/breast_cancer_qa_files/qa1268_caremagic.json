  "A": "Hi. I understood your question and I will help you. If I were your treating doctor., I would firstly ask you to do abdominal ultrasound to rule out any serious abdominal problem. Also you should know that shoulder pain and dyspepsia may persist for a period after cholecystectomy which is called post cholecystectomy syn Chat Doctor. . I advise you to regulate your meals and avoid fatty meals. Also, I need to exclude any problem in the breast as breast masses and mastitis lead to enlarged axillary lymph nodes and heaviness in the arm pit."
