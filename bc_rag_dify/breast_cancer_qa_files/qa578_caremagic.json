  "Q": "I am 11 days late for my period.  I have had PMS/pregnancy symptoms for over two weeks now, not severe ones just breast tenderness and light cramps on and off.  However, I have taken three pregnancy tests and they were all negative.  Could I still be pregnant and what should I do?",
  "A": "Hello dear, I understand your concern. Usually the urine pregnancy test is positive a week after missed period. So as the period is delayed by 11 days the pregnancy test should be positive by now in case if your cycles are regular. So the sore breasts and cramps might be mostly due to premenstrual symptoms. Wait for spontaneous onset of periods. In case if you don't get the periods I would like you to repeat the test after a week. If even then the pregnancy test is negative there is no chance of pregnancy. And then I suggest you to consult doctor for further management. Nothing to worry. Stress might also delay the periods. So avoid stress if any. Relax. Blood Chat Doctor test also helps in accurate diagnosis in ruling out the pregnancy. Hope this helps. Best regards..."
