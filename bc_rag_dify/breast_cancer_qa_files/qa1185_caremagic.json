  "Q": "I am having some pain just under my breast line on right side. I noticed it about three years ago when I would sit and play dominoes for a long while it would hurt. I used a heating pad which is what I am currently doing. If I take a fiorinal and lay with a heating pad it goes away and o am fine. I ve had gallbladder removed and a clear mammogram just this week. Just wonder if it s a muscle or what exactly. Some time it stings but feels like a bruise.",
  "A": "Hi. I can understand your concern. If the chest pain is disturbing your routine activity then get a chest x-ray done to rule out any lung infection, or it could be just a muscle pull. Do not lift heavy weightsPossibility of musculoskeletal pain is more. Ibuprofen is anti-inflammatory. You will definitely improve witChatDoctorbination of painkiller and muscle relaxant Chat Doctor.  Also apply warm water pad on affected areas. Avoid movements causing pain. Don't worry, you will be alright in 1-2 weeks. But better to first rule out lung infection.Don't worry, you will be alright. Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health. Thanks."
