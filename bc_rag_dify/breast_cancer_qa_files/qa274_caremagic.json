  "Q": "I have been getting small lumps that sometimes have puss in them, on my armpit. They are very painful and keep reoccurring. I have taken anti-biotics and that only solves the problem for a small amount of time as they eventually come back. They seem to be getting more painful and frequent. What shall i do",
  "A": "Hi! Thanks for writing to us! Well, formation of pus indicates kind of recent infection and necrosis of tissue; therefore, if were your family physician and had you consulted me for the recurrent pus formation in the armpit area, I would just think of a few possibilities like:1. A ruptured and infected epidermal cyst 2. Tuberculous infection3. Hi Chat Doctor.  Inflamed fibrotic disease in ectopic mammary tissue as in females!Therefore, you need some microbiological/histopathological testing for confirmation and thereafter the line of treatment could easily be decided by your surgeon! Please revert to us if necessary. Wishing you early recovery!"
