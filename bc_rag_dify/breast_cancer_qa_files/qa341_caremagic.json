  "Q": "I was just diagnosed with endometriosis. I am a triple negative breast cancer survivor and was put into menopause following my first chemo treatment in 2006. The endo mass is in my bladder wall. Is endovan something I should try or is it possible a complete hysterectomy will be recommended? I will be seeing my GYN in a few weeks.",
  "A": "Thanks for the query. The result of ErdoÄŸan are questionable, and you can always start with it and then decide about surgery if there is no improvement. Hysterectomy is a routine today, and it is the last option but also the most efficient for your condition. Hysterectomy would be recommended since you already have malignant disease in your medical history, and it will prevent possible uterus malignancies. I hope you'll find the best option for you. Wish you good health. Feel free to ask. Regards"
