  "Q": "I have florescent thick blue drainage coming from my left breast, I also have a elongated lump in my left breast about 2 inches going from the middle of my breast stopping just before my arm pit and I have a scaly rash all over both of my breast. Can you help me and give me some answers? I hada lumpectomy two years ago but the drng never went away, now the lump is back and bigger than before. I also have thick yellow brownish drng from my right breast but no lump.",
  "A": "Hi ! Good evening. I am Chat Doctor answering your query. You have not given any information on the biopsy report of the lumpectomy done two years back. Although it might be difficult to give opinion without the earlier biopsy report in hand, I would suggest having a cytological examination and a culture sensitivity test of the discharge from the breast, a fresh mammogram of both breasts, and a review clinical examination by the same surgeon who operated on you or some other surgeon if he is not available. All the combination result of the physical examination of your breasts and maxilla, along with the investigation reports would help the treating doctor to decide on the further management of the condition. So take care and get yourself reviewed at the earliest possible. I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem. Please do not hesitate to ask in case of any further doubts. Thanks for choosing Chat Doctor to clear doubts on your health problems. Wishing you an early recovery. Chat Doctor."
