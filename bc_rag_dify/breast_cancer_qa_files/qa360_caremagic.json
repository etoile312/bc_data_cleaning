  "Q": "I found a hard lump in my breast. It is high and towards my arm pit. It is tender to the touch but otherwise no pain. I have also had a variety of other symptoms regarding my breasts at one time or another over the last 6 months. I dont even know if one has anything to do with the other. Those symptoms are, swelling, tenderness and warmth, also a itchy red rash looks like heat rash but doesnt feel like one. Its not prickly just itchy. I also have 2 skin tag like spots that appeared underneath my breast. do you think these are all related and possibly breast cancer.",
  "A": "Hello! Thank you for the query. Yes, this can be a breast cancer. You should not wait any longer with it. Please consult gynecologist and have an ultrasound of this lump. In case of solid mass, biopsy should be done to check under a microscope if it's a cancer or not. If it is also possible that you have some inflammation or just a cyst in your breast. But cancer needs to be ruled out at first. Hope this will help. Regards."
