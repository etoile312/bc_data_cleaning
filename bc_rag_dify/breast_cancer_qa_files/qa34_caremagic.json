  "Q": "Hello. I am 30, and I had a mammogram and ultra sound today as a follow up-to a biopsy 6 months ago. Everything is fine, but my question is whether I should wait until next moth to try to get pregnant. Would the radiation affect the baby if I do get pregnant?",
  "A": "Hi, I understand your concern. Radiation affects fetus differently at differently. It depends on the time & extent of exposure to radiation. Actually radiation reaches fetus in comparatively less dose, as it goes through mothers body to reach it.  - Radiation exposure in first 2 weeks of conception may cause fetal death.  - exposure to large dose radiation( Like dose received from 500 chest X-rays) in early weeks of conception (2 to 18 weeks of pregnancy) is hazardous to fetus- it causes developmental defects in fetus-specially brain developments.- leading to low IQ s & mental retardation or stunted growth./ likelihood to develop cancer in later life.  _ Same type of consequences are observed in fetuses between 18 and 26 weeks when exposed to double the dose of radiation.  -After 26 weeks baby is fully grown & there is no possibility of developmental defects after radiation exposure except for slightly more chances of having cancer in later life.  * Though no bad effects of radiation exposure of mother before conception are reflected on fetuses, the conception should be postponed, specially when it is a planned conception. It can be easily postponed till next month.  Thanks."
