  "Q": "My father is scheduled to have his bladder removed this week due to cancer that has not responded to chemo therapeutic treatments. Is there a web site I can refer to him where he can read about the procedure and what life will be like afterward? The surgery will remove a portion of his intestine and it will be implanted beneath the skin and he will have to catherize himself. I think",
  "A": "Hi, Thanks for writing in. You father might have to undergo complete mastectomy (removal of urinary bladder) with the creation of an ideal conduit which will serve as a bladder reservoir. Radical mastectomy remains one of the most effective methods of control of invasive bladder cancer. The construction of an ideal conduit remains a tried and tested method of urinary diversion. The two ureters are cut away from the urinary bladder insertions and the bladder is removed. Then the ureters are joined and then punt inside a loop of intestine created for this purpose. Then the bowel loop is diverted into an opening in the abdominal wall and a stoma is created. A catheter can be used to Chat Doctor.  Please do not worry."
