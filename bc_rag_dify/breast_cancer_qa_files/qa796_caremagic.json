  "Q": "i have shortness of breath, abdominal fullness on right side, right breast pain burning discomfort, right arm and shoulder discomfort and weakness, anemia and I have pinsize blood dots on my chest, back and legs.  Feel like I constantly have a flu.  what do you think is the problem?",
  "A": "HI. This can be a serious problem of bleeding diaeresis as you have a history of blood dots on the body. The pains on one side of the body and a flu like symptoms can be due to the same blood spots affecting the brain on the left side hence you have problems on right (opposite side). I would advise you the following:Take a consultation of a Neurologist as soon as possible. Get an MRI of the brain with contrast. Blood tests including bleeding time, clotting time, platelet count, prothrombin tests, The treatment will depend upon the diagnosis."
