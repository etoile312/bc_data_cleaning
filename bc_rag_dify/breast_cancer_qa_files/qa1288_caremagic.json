  "Q": "Hi, Ive been on depo consistently for 4 Years now. My last injection was Oct.1 I was due Dec.17-Dec.31for a follow up but I missed it...And Ive been having unprotected sex with my boyfriend since November. I used the bathroom yesterday, and it was light pink blood on the tissue.. and my breast have been tender the past 2weeks. Could I be pregnant?",
  "A": "Hi It is just possible that you are pregnant if you did not take your next in. In time. But these can also be the side effects of demo in. Breast tenderness is quite common and there is usually amenorrhea (no periods) after the use of this in. And it takes some time in conceiving after discontinuing it. This in. Should not be used for more than 2 years continuously for birth control method. So, I will advise you to get a scan done to rule out pregnancy and then use some other method of contraception. Probably you might not be pregnant. Thanks."
