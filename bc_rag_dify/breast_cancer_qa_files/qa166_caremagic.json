  "Q": "hey am 24yrs, weight 105, 5ft, I had an open myomectomy last year december, right now am around 5months since then. I have pains along myback at the wasteline and also at the edges of my abdomen. I tried getting pregnant this but unsuccessful. PLEASE ADVICE ME. Thank you",
  "A": "Hi, I think you can try naturally for 6 months to one year because mastectomy doesn't affect conception. But if it doesn't work in 6 months, get yourself evaluated.  Do a thyroid profile and prolactin levels and an ultrasound for your uterus and ovaries.  Also do a HSG to see the tubal patency.  A semen analysis of your husband should be done.  If everything is fine, you can try for 6 more months.  Be in contact with your husband every 2 to 3 days after your periods stop.  IT will increase chances of your pregnancy.  Hope I have answered your question. Regards Chat Doctor. "
