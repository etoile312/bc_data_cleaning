  "Q": "Last night I woke around 4 am because I had what I thought was a spasm in my lungs. It hurt so badly on my right side, it went up to my jaw and actually my gums hurt as did my ears.  I thought I had water in my ears they hurt so badly.  It lasted approx 1/2 hour and I was scared to death that I was having a heart attack, but the pain was on my sternum and towards the right.  I also have breast cancer, been going through chemo (Halaven). Had a oxgen test today - was 100%; had chest x-ray- nothing showed.  Do you have an idea of whats going on.",
  "A": "You probably had an attack of bronchospasm last night. You need to take bronchodilators at that time to get relief. Such attacks are not common either due to cancer or due to chemotherapy. You need to get pulmonary function tests to check lung reserve. Heaven is not know to cause such side effects. You probably had an allergic reaction. Re check your diet and environment and list of medications carefully and try to identify the allergen which has precipitated the attack. Be careful to avoid exposure to that allergen again"
