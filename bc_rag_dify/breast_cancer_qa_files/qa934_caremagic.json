  "Q": "I have recently been diagnosed with DCIS stage 0. Looking back on CBC reports since 2011, I have noticed a higher than normal level in Monocytes ranging from a high of 11.2 to the current low of 9.4. Is this higher than normal range for the Monocytes indicative of the cancer? Also, could the highest level of Monocytes on the test show when the cancer actually developed?",
  "A": "Hi, dear. I have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. You have ductal carcinoma in situ. Your monocytes count has no relation with cancer. Its normal range is 2 to 8 %. Your count is of 9%. So It's almost near normal.  Even mild viral infection or infectious mononucleosis may cause elevated monocyte count.  So don't worry about that. Just be relaxed. It has nothing to do with your cancer. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health."
