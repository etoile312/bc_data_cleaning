  "Q": "my daughter who is age 19 1/2 went to gynocologist and has a lump in her right breast.  about 1 1/2 years ago she had a lump and it disappeared and now reappeared.  the doctor pressed on it and she felt a slight pain.  she is going for an ultrasound next week but i am nervous about it.  why would it disappear and then reappear almost 2 years later.",
  "A": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your daughter s situation and problem. In my opinion she is having breast swelling due to fluctuations in hormones. In young age, hormonal fluctuations can occur. And this causes fat deposition in breast tissue. This fat deposition can be perceived as swelling in breast. But better to get done mammography for conformation of fat swelling. Also get done hormone levels to rule out hormonal imbalance and consult gynecologist for treatment. If it is fat swelling then no need for any treatment, just treatment for hormonal imbalance is needed. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wishing good health to your daughter. Thanks."
