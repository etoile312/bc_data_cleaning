  "Q": "I have had Parkinsons disease for 20 years.  Now (diagnosed in 2008)have breast cancer, had mastectomy, chemo, & radiation.  Now the breastcancer has spread to my bones.  With the PD I fall alot..  I thoughtthat the bump on my elbow was from falling all the time.  Now I readon computer that there is such a thing as elbow cancer.  Mine is on]the left elbow ( doesnt hurt at all), but ios geting bigger and smootherevery day.   What should I do?",
  "A": "Hi I did understand your concern. There is no such thing as elbow cancer, however there can be several types of growth that can present as elbow swelling. They can be benign or malignant. It can be reactive due to soft tissue swelling. It can also be due to lymphatic removal from the mastectomy you had if the cancer was on left breast. I would recommend you to consult a doctor and if needed to get a fine needle aspiration cytology or a biopsy done to see what are cells making up the swelling. Also, if required the doctor may order an imaging study like an MRI of the left extremity to know from where is the lesion arising(bone, muscle,soft tissue). I HOPE THIS HELPS"
