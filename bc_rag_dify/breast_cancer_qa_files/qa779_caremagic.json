  "Q": "I used Krimson for 11 month. Due to severe head ache, and in activity, drowsinees and other problems, i stopped teh medicine in between with the doctors advice. Will there be any problem, what are the side effects that i need to face in the coming days, and what care need to be taken?",
  "A": "Hello, Abrupt stoppage of this medicine does cause side effects. This medicine should neither be started nor stopped without the consultation of a GP. However, if you have symptoms of breast pain, stomach ache or chest pain or discomfort you should visit ER and get clinically assessed. Side effects include increased risk of breast and cervical cancer, increased risk of heart attacks & stroke, gallbladder disease & liver dysfunctions. Hope I have answered your question. Let me know if I can assist you further. "
