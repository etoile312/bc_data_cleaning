  "A": "Hi, Siphene is primarily used to treat female infertility. It works by stimulating an increase in the amount of hormones that support the growth and release of a mature egg (ovulation). Its common side effects include stomach upset, bloating, abdominal / pelvic fullness, flushing, breast tenderness, and headache. Austen is a form of female hormone progesterone commonly prescribed to regularize the menstrual periods, support and maintain an early pregnancy. Generally it is well tolerated however it may cause headache, breast tenderness, and abdominal pain. Continue to take them as prescribed. Hope I have answered your question. Let me know if I can assist you further. "
