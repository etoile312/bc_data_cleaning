  "Q": "Hi there, my mother was 93 years old a breast cancer survivor that was diagnosed at age 80. However, she was having shortness of breath for a few days but when the visiting nurse came she detected funny breathing with I believe low pressure, she was taken to the er and we was told her potassium level was low and waited for medication to go home, but during the wait we (the family) laughed and had good talk with my mom. Until she started saying she couldn t breath, the medical staff worked on her for some time, and showed me what I was seeing on the monitor wasn t my mom breathing on her own it was the aspirator they were assisting with after the machines didn t work, my mother also had unsusal heart rhythms for many years and we had stopped the memo months before because of weakness, this all happen a few yes ago, but I could not help wondering if we could have done something earlier. As I said she was in good spirits waiting to go home and Pow. Your input please. Thank you Tina G",
  "A": "Hi Dear !! Thanks for your query to Chat Doctor. Read and reviewed your query and health concerns. IN the given situation of Your mother, she seems to have suffered from-Silent heart attack with hypokalemia and shortness of breath, while in wait in ER. Dear, the facts show that she had a silent heart attack with only complaint of shortness of breath with low pressure since few days earlier to ER visit. Other causes for this precipitation of shortness of breath could be -aspiration pneumonia, from reclining position, precipitating heart attack under the garb of shortness of breath of your mother. Dear Such events IN ER waiting could have been avoided but for GODS wishes, and for her advanced age of 93. You could have saved her provided, shortness of breath in last few days was taken seriously and was treated vigorously, with better outcome of survival of her life. A right treatment at those early moments of shortness of breath, would have given her normal life. But dear, everything cant go right when GOD DESIRES the other way. Second opinion with attending Cardiologist on these lines would resolve your anxiety more. Hope this would help you to plan further of this complex illness of yours.
