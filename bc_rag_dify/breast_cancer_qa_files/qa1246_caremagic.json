  "A": "Hi Dear, Welcome to Chat Doctor. Understanding your concern. As per your query you have sharp pain below the breast and the armpit. Well this is cause primarily by hormonal fluctuations. This means that the most likely times to experience breast pain are during the days before your period, or when approaching menopause, also due to caffeine, alcohol, fatty foods, and high salt intake. Also, lymph node swelling and condition like breast cancer can cause such symptoms. I would suggest you to consult general practitioner for proper examination. Doctor may order mammogram and blood test to confirm the cause. Doctor may refer you to gynecologist for hormonal therapy. For now apply warm compresses and take ibuprofen or acetaminophen. Hope your concern has been resolved. Get Well Soon. Best Wishes,"
