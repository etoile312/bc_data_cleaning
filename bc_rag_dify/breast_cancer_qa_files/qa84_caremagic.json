  "Q": "Hi, may I answer your health queries right now ?  Please type your query here...Hello DoctorI have gone through CABG on 6th Jan 2011 but there is pain on the left side of the stitches and i feel there is slight swelling on the right side of the breast. Do i need to see a cardiologist",
  "A": "Hello, It could be a localized pus collection near the stitches site resulting in abscess formation. A chest x-ray PA view could be helpful before visit a doctor for an opinion. I would advise you to take the opinion of a general surgeon as he would examine both the stitches site and right breast swelling and advice tests and medications accordingly. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further."
