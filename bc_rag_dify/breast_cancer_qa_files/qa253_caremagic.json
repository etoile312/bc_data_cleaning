  "Q": "I have been diagnosed with PCOS in 2003. I was on medication (Diane 35 for 5 years and aldactone for 9 years). I was told to continue aldactone. In Feb this year I found a breast lump which was diagnosed as fibro adenoma . The doc said the lump may be because of aldactone. I have stopped all medication since Feb 2012. I had very irregular periods (once in 15 days). After stopping aldactone, I am getting almost regular periods. I have been TTC since Nov. 2011 and still no success. I am 26 years old now. BMI is 24.6. What steps should I take now to conceive normally?",
  "A": "Hi, Most important step is lifestyle modification: Healthy diet + at least 30Â min. Of sweat inducing exercise daily. Since you are having irregular periods, you are not ovulating regularly for which you can take simple tablets after consulting you doctor. Another way is Laparoscopic ovarian puncture, which will resume ovulation in about 50% cases. But as laparoscopy is invasive operation, it's better to go for simple treatment first unless laparoscopy is indicated for other reasons."
