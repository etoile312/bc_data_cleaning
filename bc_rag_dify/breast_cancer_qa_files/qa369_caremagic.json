  "Q": "I got the copper t inserted on May 6th then I got my period 3 weeks later. This month I had unprotected sex last week on the 17th and my period was sopposed to be between the 21-25. I am having a lot of cramps and I also have breast tenderness. I also have this brown discharge which is like old blood instead of fresh blood. Could this be implantation bleeding or does it mean that I m about to have my period?",
  "A": "Hallow Dear, The intrauterine devices can prevent only intrauterine pregnancy and not the ectopic pregnancy. Since along with some bleeding you are having severe abdominal pain, please get checked for ectopic pregnancy. First get your pregnancy test done on overnight early morning first urine sample. If the test is positive, please get ultrasonography done. If there are no products seen in the uterine cavity, the chances of ectopic pregnancy are high. Alternatively, get Beta Chat Doctor test done on the blood. Values under 5 mid/ml will rule out the pregnancy; values above 25 mid are diagnostic of pregnancy. Any values between 5mIU/ml and 25 mid/ml are suggestive of ectopic pregnancy where ultrasonography can be of help. Ectopic pregnancy is a condition where pregnancy is implanted somewhere outside the uterine cavity, most commonly the tube. This pregnancy does not grow and there are chances of rupture with alarming intra-abdominal bleeding requiring surgical intervention with many units of blood transfusion. Please report to the Gynecologist ASAP. I hope this convinces you. "
