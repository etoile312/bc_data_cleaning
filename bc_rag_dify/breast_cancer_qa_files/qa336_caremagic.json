  "Q": "my brother was diagnosis with bladder cancer in jan of this year. His urologist kept him coming back doing biopsy and tests until the end of march, He said that cancer had spreaded to the wall of his bladder and that he needed to have it removed. Was this a good idea to wait so long",
  "A": "Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. Your brother has cancer in bladder cancer. Treatment depends on stage of bladder cancer. If it limited to the bladder wall then it could be in early stage. Mastectomy should be done as early as possible. Consult your doctor and start treatment. Don't wait so long now. Hope I have answered your question, if you have any doubts then contact me at bit.ly/ Chat Doctor. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health."
