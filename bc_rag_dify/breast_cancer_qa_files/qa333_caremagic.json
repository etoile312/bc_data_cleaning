  "Q": "i found a painless lump in my armpit above the skin that fells like it starts deeper with a lump under the skin les than an inch away from the visible one. there is breast cancer in my bloodline and i just wanted to make sure its not something to serious.",
  "A": "Welcome to Chat Doctor .1. The pain less lump in the axillary region would suspect lymph nodal enlargement.2. Lymph nodal enlargement cause due to underlying infection / inflammation / malignancies / and systemic diseases.3. You have given family history of breast cancer. In this case I would ask you to see your doctor and let the doctor examine.4. If you came to me, I would examine, and then with your history I would ask for an ultrasound scan both breasts as precaution (as some tiny lumps, and there are few non lump cancers) depending on your age - A mammogram.5. So take appointment when ever possible and follow the problem, may be not an issue but better be confident. Hope it helps you. Wish you a good health. Anything to ask ? Do not hesitate. Thank you."
