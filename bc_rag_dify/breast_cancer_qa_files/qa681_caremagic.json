  "Q": "I have currently survived breast cancer and possibly have skin cancer on my right earlobe...so now I think everything is cancer. A really large egg shaped lump came up on my right butt cheek. It seem like an abcess to me. Could it be possible cancer?",
  "A": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your fear. But every skin lump is not always malignancy in your case. Yes, chances are high, but skin lump can be due to other causes like infection or allergy. In your case at present I think you should first get done clinical examination of your lump. Then ultrasound examination and biopsy from the lump. Biopsy is needed in any lump for confirmation of diagnosis. In my opinion it seems abscess mostly."
