  "Q": "I had breast cancer 2 years ago and have just come off tamoxifen and put on A I inhibitors. As a result I had a base line  dexa scan this morning. The radiographer asked if I had pains in my spine as it was showing something abnormal.  I have to wait 2 weeks for results and am now convinced that I have  a bone tumour.  Can a dexa scan pick up bone cancer?",
  "A": "Hi, Thanks for writing in. A DEXA scan gives bone mineral density that is calculated with the help of low intensity X-rays. The usual measurements are made from the spine and long bones. Short for dual-energy X-ray absorption, the DEXA scan who's the chances of osteoporosis or bone fractures. This scan can also help detect if cancer has metastasized, or spread, to the bones. When cancer spreads to the bone then the bone density changes as there is weakness. Rarely bone density can also rise. This activity happens in a focused area and is able to be detected on the DEXA much before it is seen in the X-ray. The radiographer asked you if you have pains to be certain if any particular area requires assessment in detail. Please do not worry."
