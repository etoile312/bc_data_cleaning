  "Q": "Hi. Ive had a skin tag under my left breast for the last 5 or so years. Its grown a little over the years but hasnt really been a problem. A few days ago Ive noticed that its grown and now has a wart like hard type bottom and the top is a blackish color. It has also gotten raw at times and is painful at times not just irritating but sore to the touch.",
  "A": "Hi and welcome to Chat Doctor.  I understand your concerns and I will try to help you as much as I can. This is probably a fibroadenoma which is a benign breast growth and usually there is a slow size progression over the years. I think that at this point you should do breast ultrasound and have a biopsy to be sure that this is not something more serious. Then it can be removed under local anesthesia by a general or plastic surgeon. In every case it doesn't sound serious to me if this lasts for more than 5 years. I hope I have answered you query. If you have any further questions you can contact us in every time. Kindly regards. Wish you a good health."
