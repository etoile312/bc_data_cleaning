  "Q": "On my right index finger is a hard pea sized lump which I assumed was a cyst from the knitting needle pressing on that location often. It is painful to the touch and nonmovable.  Developed last fall and has not changed since appearing. About 4 wks ago, discovered a new hard lump, nonmoveable without pain on inner upper right thigh, also about size of pea, thought was cyst from dogs nail bruising leg but has not changed. Am a breast cancer survivor from stage 3 with lymphatic nodes involved.  Wait till annual or should I have checked? Female, 57, otherwise good health.",
  "A": "Hi, Dear,Thanks for the query to Chat Doctor. I studied your query in depth. I feel concerned about it. In my opinion, the painless hard lump could be -an inguinal metastasis, as its painless. A dogs nail bruising leg, could also cause such lump on inner thigh, but would have been sore to touch. As its 4 wk old lump -FNAC-biopsy is advised to fix the cause of this lump from the various possibilities discussed above. Surgeon-in ER needs to be consulted and would resolve the worry you have. A course of antibiotic would reduce the dog nail induced lymph amenities, and the secondary Mets would not reduce with antibiotics and NSAIDs. Chances of Mets are less-looking to the cancer remission for long, but needs to be ruled out by FNAC biopsy, and abdominopelvic CAT scan study. Hope this would relieve your worry of the painless lump on inner thigh. Wellcome for more query soon if you need so."
