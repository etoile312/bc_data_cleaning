  "Q": "I am having extreme pain on my left side slightly below and and to the right of my armpit. The pain does not bother me much when upright, or when working. (I am a carpet installer and do a lot of heavy lifting, etc.) The pain is worse at night if I try to roll over on my side in bed or on the sofa. Standing up is very painful, but once I m up it is not as bad. Sometimes, turning my head to the left, or back causes a lot of discomfort.I, m hoping it s a pinched nerve, or pulled muscle. The pain is very sharp, and almost immobilizing.",
