  "Q": "what are the chances of my breast cancer stage 2 returning if I discontinue femara. I had one lymph node withcancer. I have been taking femara for about one year. I am 73 years old and still have my ovaries, after a hysterectomy in my fifties. I have been toke to take femara for 3 years. Thank you, Pamela",
  "A": "Dear Ma'am, Sorry to hear about your problem. Female reduces the chances of cancer coming back by almost 40% and also prevents the risk of getting cancer in the other breast. If you discontinue this medicine, there is a significant chance of the cancer coming back. Did you receive chemotherapy after your surgery? If no chemotherapy was given, then it is all the more important that you continue taking female. The total duration of treatment with female is 5 years. I hope I have answered your question.
