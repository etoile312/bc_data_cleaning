  "Q": "Hello, i have a problem in my inner thighs, Ive had some problems in the past with rashes down there and my main problem is the smell. Its some sort of bad odor from my inner thighs to my testicles, no matter how much i scrub soap down there in a couple of minutes the smell comes back. What should i do? Im 18 and i recently moved to Brazil, could it  be this intense Brazilian heat?",
  "A": "Hello and welcome to Chat Doctor I would keep a possibility of Intertwine, which is inflammation of the body folds. There is superimposed candida infection in most cases (Candida Intertwine). Clinically intertwine presents as red, moist, scaly patches of skin on closely opposed body folds. Foul smell is mostly due to bacterial overgrowth. Closely opposing body folds e.g. thighs/groin, maxilla, submammary folds etc. can trap sweat, heat and moisture, therefore making the area prone to Intertwine, specially in those involved in strenuous physical activity. If I was the treating doctor I would have asked to use an OTC topical antifungal like clotrimazole cream, twice daily, regularly for 4 weeks. An OTC antihistamine e.g. cetirizine 10 mg tablet, once daily would help in symptomatic itch relief. An Antifungal dusting powder e.g. clotrimazole dusting powder, would not only keep the area Chat Doctor. Regards"
