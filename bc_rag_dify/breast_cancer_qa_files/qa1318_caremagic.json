  "Q": "i am a 46 yr old female with right breast discharge. I have had a mammogram and 2 ultrasounds and have been referred to a breast cancer surgeon who has recommended that i have a ductal removal and biopsy. My question is what is entailed in this procedure and what is the doctor looking for since both mammogram and ultrasound has been declareds normal?",
  "A": "Hi, Thanks for writing in. It is important to know what symptoms you are facing which prompted 2 ultrasound and a mammogram. There might be a clinical suspicion from the cancer surgeon after clinical examination and the ultrasound of breast also might show doubtful findings and this might suggest the need for a biopsy even if the study is normal. Biopsy of duct is important to recognize ductal cancer in early stages. There might be some altered clinical findings which have led to the doctor refer you for a second ultrasound and because of persisting doubt there is a requirement of confirmation through biopsy. Please do not worry."
