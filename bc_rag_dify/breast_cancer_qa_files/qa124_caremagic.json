  "Q": "I have had my my nipple pierced for about 6 years and Ive never had this happen before but a couple of hours ago noticed that it was swollen and sore. I took the ring out and squeezed it to relieve so pressure and i felt a popping sensation and a combination of blood and puss came out. I cleaned it with hydrogen peroxide and put neosporin on it. Is this a sign of an infection? Should I see my primary doctor about this or can I treat it myself?",
