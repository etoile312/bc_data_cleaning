  "Q": "I am a 23 year old.I had a tumor in my breast and got it removed by operation.Now after 5 years i have developed other tumor in the same breast but in a different location. what could be the reason for this and are there chances for breast cancer.Kindly suggest a solution.",
  "A": "Hi. What was the histopathology of the tumor removed 5 years ago. In young females fibroadenoma is the common tumor type. They are benign tumors and can be easily diagnosed on mammogram complimented by sonomammogram (ultrasound scan of breast) and confirmed by FNAC (fine needle aspiration cytology). If you can share the histopathology report of previous surgery, I would be able to advise you better. Meanwhile, all breast lumps should be investigated in the manner that I have mentioned earlier to rule out cancer (malignancy). Wishing you happy health.
