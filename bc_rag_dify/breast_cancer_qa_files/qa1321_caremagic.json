  "Q": "my breast ultrasound report states that I have an irregularhypoechonic leison, andOn sonoghraphic grounds, the appearances suggest a significant lesion and would anticipate the core biopsy results to reflect this What does the term, significant imply in this context? thanks LKS",
  "A": "Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. Your ultrasound report suggests significant lesion.  It means lesion can not be ignored. It needs further investigation to rule out cancer.  So you should go for core biopsy or fine needle aspiration cytology to confirm the diagnosis. Then you should take treatment accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health."
