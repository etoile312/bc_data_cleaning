  "Q": "My father was diagnosed with adenocarcinoma of the colon with mucin-secreting signet ring cells with malignancy, at the age of 63 and was immediately advised to undergo surgical resection, but unfortunately passed away 3 days after surgery due to cardiac arrest. He did not have any other medical conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, or such. I am 36 years old and I am worried if this is a genetic condition and will I be inheriting it? Please advise what precautions I should take.",
