  "Q": "Had this persistant pain in left side between bottom rib and hip for two years now since having radiotherapy for treatment of breast cancer I also get stomach pain and bowel problems. I have recently had a lower bowel scan which was clear. The scan could not be completed because I have a lot of scar tissue from a hysterectomy 37 years ago and it caused too much pain for the doctor to carry on the test.",
  "A": "Hello Thank you for trusting Chat Doctor Dear when you have undergone radiation therapy, what doctors told about your problem??? Usually radiation therapy can cause, osteoradionecrosis on bone may give rise pain but when you radiation exposure was done?? Don't worry please consult your radiotherapist /oncologist he will guide in correct way. Radiation may cause mucositis and ulcer formation leads to pain in bowel but as you told scan and copy are normal. For abdominal pain please consult gastroenterologist. Feel free to ask any query."
