  "A": "Hi, Thanks for writing to Chat Doctor. There are 2 things which happens in breast one is fibroadenomas in which you have pain and diffuse modularity. There will be no formed swelling in breast. 2nd is fibroadenoma in which there will be well-formed swelling which moves freely in breast, and it will not be painful. For fibroadenomas primrose and Evian is useful to treat it. For well-formed fibroadenoma treatment is surgical removal. It won't reduce by you medication. At age of 26yrs it is very less likely to have cancer unless in your family you have many blood related females with breast cancer. Still if you have doubt you can get done FNAC. It is needle aspiration of swelling, and it is examined to know whether it is cancer or not. Hope I have been helpful. Regards Chat Doctor. "
