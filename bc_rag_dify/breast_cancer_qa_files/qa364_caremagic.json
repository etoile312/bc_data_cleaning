  "Q": "I am 45 years old and have a dull pain in my left chest from my back all the way thru my breast. I had a mammogram to rule out any breast issue and it came back clear. I have shortness of breath but not all the time. The pain was more frequent when I slowed down in the evenings, but in the last week or so it is there almost all the time. It woke me up last night and the night before. I don t have any heart disease in my family. I don t know what direction to go in and it is starting to be a problem.",
  "A": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your situation and problem. Since it is left sided chest pain, we need to rule out cardiac cause first. Your other symptoms like breathlessness and low energy in evenings with nighttime awakening can be seen in heart disease. So please get done1. ECG 2. 2D ECHO3. Stress test. If everything is normal than no need to worry much. You may have anxiety associated muscular pain. So avoid stress and anxiety.  Be relax and calm.  Take good painkiller and muscle relaxant."
