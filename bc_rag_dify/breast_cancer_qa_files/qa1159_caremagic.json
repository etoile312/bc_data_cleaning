  "Q": "Hello, I have sore gums on the right side of my mouth which developed last week and I discovered a pea sized lump under my right arm pit two nights ago. Today the sides of my jaw and chin ache. I have felt occasional light nausea over the part few days. I have also booked an appointment with my dentist and doctor for this week. I am concerned it could be cancer or even HIV. I am hoping it us just a less serious virus or infection. Should I be worried? Many thanksWilliam",
  "A": "Hello. Welcome to Chat Doctor. Thanks for your query. I have gone through your query and understand your concern. Just a sore gum can not be an Oral cancer. It may be due to local infection in base of teeth and gums. As far as your arm pit lump is concerned, it may be due enlarged axillary lymph nodes. The usual causes are infection. But breast cancer also cause the axillary lymph node swelling.Thus, i advice you to have through physical examination by your Primary care physician and then consult a dentist for further management. Chin ache and muscle ache are due to referred pain from infection in gums or muscular pain. Please check ELISA or Western blot to rule out HIV. Hope this helps. Please reply for further queries. Wishing you good health."
