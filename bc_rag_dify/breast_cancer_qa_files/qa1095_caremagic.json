  "Q": "I have recently been in hospital for breast cancer and had 2 subsequent operations.  One month later had a routine blood test and was told that my ALT was 45, Gamma 125 and ALP 35, all raised.  I used to drink quite a lot of alcohol, but havent had any for around 2 months.  Will my liver enzymes go back to normal?",
  "A": "FATTY Liver and welcome to Chat Doctor. Thank you for your query. I am Chat Doctor, I understand your concerns and I will try to help you as much as I can. These should normalize within 2-3 months unless there is some other specific liver disease or metastases due to primary cancer. SO you need to do liver ct scan and check markers in few weeks. Also some medications and alcohol or chemotherapy may came it as well. I hope I have answered you query. If you have any further questions you can contact us in every time. Kindly regards. Wish you a good health. Chat Doctor. "
