  "Q": "I am having breast pain in my right breast. I had a mammogram on Wednesday and felt fine before the test. Now it is a dull, sometimes more sharp pain. The mammogram was hurtful more than in the past. The Doctors office has installed a new machine (my first time with this one) and it did hurt more than normal. I could feel the skin pulling tight. I am concerned because it hurts more at night when I am trying to sleep. I ve had many Mammograms in the past, like every year. I am 76 years old.",
  "A": "Hello, I have studied your case with diligence. As per your history there is possibility of breast cancer. If your blood reports are normal I will advise you to do PET scan to look for any lesion in initial stage. Mammography may not be sensitive. Till time Chat Doctor. Hope this answers your query.
