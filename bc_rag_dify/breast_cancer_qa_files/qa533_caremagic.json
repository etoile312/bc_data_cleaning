  "A": "Ovulation and pregnancy is not very easy process. It is natures most beautiful and one of complex process in its own. Now if your follicles is not increasing you may have to do some test. Do not know that whether your doctor have done it or not. Get it done. MAMMOGRAM, URINE ROUTINE, TSH LEVEL, FSH, LH, PROLACTIN LEVEL. And one sonography. These all are basic ones. You may require some more tests. And some more medications. Get a consultation with infertologist with your husband and get understand the complete process. It is time-consuming process and 100s of factors are involved in it. You have to be patience because if you are ovulating than also we get only one chance in a month for pregnancy. So get understand the complete plan of treatment and react accordingly."
