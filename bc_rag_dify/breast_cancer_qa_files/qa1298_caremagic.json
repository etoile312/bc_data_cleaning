  "Q": "i have a small lump on my 2nd rib below my right breast. I have seen my GP and he is sending me for an ultrasound. I am 16 weeks pregnant and extremely worried it could be a cancerous lump. Is this likely? I am 32 years old and in good health with no background of ill health. There is no history of cancer on my mother s side of the family however my father died of prostate cancer aged 62 .",
  "A": "Hi.it is best if you have that breast ultrasound done as directed, if you want to know if there is truly a lesion or mass on your breast. It is safe even for your pregnancy. If further investigation will be needed such as mammography, abdominal shielding is advised. If indeed there is a mass on your breast, next step would be a tissue diagnosis of that lump through a biopsy. It could just be an inflammatory reaction, a simple cyst or other probable breast pathology. you'll be guided accordingly by your physician through these steps. The biopsy would tell you the nature of the mass/lump, and you'll be managed accordingly. Hope this helps. Good day!!~ Chat Doctor. "
