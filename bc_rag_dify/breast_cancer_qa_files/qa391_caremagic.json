  "Q": "I am on the Mylan 25 mgh Fentanyl patch for spinal mets pain. I have also been taking Tamoxifen for hormone treatment for breast cancer. I am very, very anxious from the Tamoxifen, so my onc prescribed 1 mg. Lorazepam for anxiety; however, I am afraid to take it since it also depresses respiration. Is there any other med for anxiety that I could take with Fentanyl? I am also anxious about the patch. It does take care of the pain, but I feel uncomfortable with it, knowing its potency.",
  "A": "His had gone through your query. I understand your concern about anxiety. Lorazepam is the safest anxiolytic for anxiety. It has very low dependence level. It can be taken up to 2 to 4 mg and with 1Â mg there are no complication like respiratory depression. So do not worry about it. You can take 1 mg of lorazepam for anxiety but take your treating doctors advise. Fentanyl is not used for anxiety and it won't help much in anxiety or psychological distress. Mild dose of SSRI like Escitalopram or paroxetine will help in anxiety. Relaxation methods like yoga, deep breathing exercise, meditations and progressive muscle relaxation will help.Stress-free activities and identify stress trigger events, try to modify it. Avoid smoking and alcohol. Take proper sleep and diet. I hope I have answered your query. Wish you very good health. Thank you."
