  "Q": "My mother had breast cancer 10 years back. After surgery she got lymphedema in hand. Yesterday she felt unbearable pain in her hand and her hand became red and now she is suffering from fever. Probably this is due to infection. What should we do right now?",
  "A": "Hello, She may be either having cellulitis or deep vein thrombosis of her hand. I shall advise to not wait and consult to your doctor. He may need some blood examination like CBC, ESR, CRP and Doppler test. She needs a prescription of a broad spectrum antibiotic. Meanwhile, you may give her an anti-inflammatory analgesic like Tylenol or aspirin for relief.  Hope I have answered your question. Let me know if I can assist you further. "
