  "A": "Hi, I had gone through your question and understand your concerns. This may be causes by several issues and most common are choledocholithasis which suggests that there is stone in common bile duct, secondly, it may indicate cholangitis or cholecystitis and thirdly, hepatitis, so you need to do liver ultrasound, check viral markers and do ERCP for a start. This will show us if I am right. By this you need to avoid hematologic medications and have easier diet. Hope this answers your question. If you have additional questions or follow-up questions then please do not hesitate in writing to us. I will be happy to answer your questions. Wishing you good health."
