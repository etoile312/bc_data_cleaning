  "Q": "Hi.  51 year old female.  Health history - bilateral breast cancer.  Bilateral mastectomy 4 years agoSevere pain under right scapula which radiates to under my right implant - onset 1 month agoShortness of breathFatigueNon-smokerIve had a cough since July and Ive had 3 URIs in past 2 monthsThe pain wakes me during my sleep hours. Odd symptom - I itch over the pain under my scapulaAny suggestions?Thanks",
  "A": "Hi, you have cough since July, it should be clear that whether it is with treatment, or without treatment. If with treatment continuing means it may be lower respiratory disease, or due to edema of the uvula, or tuberculosis, which can cause pain in the chest.  Any change in the implant can cause the pain, U.T.I. has nothing to do with this pain, but it should not recur so frequently, so I advise you to get the culture and sensitivity of urine and have treatment accordingly.  So for all these I advise you to consult a surgeon for diagnosis and treatment. Thank you."
