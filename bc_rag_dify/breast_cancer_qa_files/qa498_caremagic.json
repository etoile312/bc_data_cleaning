  "Q": "I am 71, very active  and just learned about 2 weeks ago that I have intraductal carcinoma in situ of the breast.  I am having a difficult time trying to determine if I should have a lumpectomy with potential radiation and hormone therapy or a simple mastectomy.  This area of calcification was picked up on mammography (yearly study) and they didnt know if I could have had it in 2009 since it is  right up against the chest wall which made it difficult to capture via xray.  If I should need radiation would proton thereapy be an option.  I have had 2 brothers that had this method of treatment for prostate cancer.  I really do not wish to take hormone therapy if at all possible because of the side effects that I have read.  I would be grateful for your comments.  I live about 160 miles away from Oklahoma City.  Thank you.",
  "A": "Hi, Thanks for writing in. Intraductal carcinoma is a cancer of the lactiferous ducts in the breast. Treatment for intramural carcinoma requires a planned treatment approach. This includes lumpectomy for small tumors and wide excision for tumors that might be excised. For tumors which are fixed to the muscles of chest wall, it is better to avoid surgery as first line of treatment and give radiation and chemotherapy and then decide if surgery is possible. Hormone sensitive cancers work better with exogenous hormones. Some tumors are estrogen receptor sensitive and these will show improvement with hormone targeted therapy. Please do not worry."
