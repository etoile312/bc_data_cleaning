  "Q": "Hi I have had this knife pain in my left shoulder blade due to my breast implants for a few years, then one day something popped in my shoulder blade, I feel like I can t take a deep breath, pins and needles down my left arm, I also have needling pain all over my upper back. My back is so tight since it popped, I have not been able to breathe properly for one year now since this happen. Please help me.",
  "A": "Hello, Its very common after surgery and especially breast surgery. You need to do regular exercises. You can get ultrasonic therapy from any nearby physiotherapist.  If no relief in that then you can get local infiltration in your shoulder. Its very simple and OLD procedure. It will alleviate your pain and will help you do exercises. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Take care Chat Doctor. "
