  "Q": "my friend has breast cancer and is receiving chemo treatment. she recently developed a rash on her arms and her eyes are tearing. also her left eye is swollen. I do not believe she has a rash anywhere else on her body. Her immune system is compromised because of the chemo, and I m wonderingif she picked up the german measles somewhere.",
  "A": "Hi Dear, Understanding your concern. As per your query you have symptoms of rash in the arms which is very common due to impaired immunity and side effects of therapy sessions. Need not worry. I would suggest you to keep this area clean and Chat Doctor.  You should avoid touching or pricking rashes. If condition doesn't get better than consult dermatologist for proper examination. Doctor will examine physically along with blood test and sample for lab test. Doctor may prescribe antibiotics like clindamycin along with steroid ointment.  Apply ice pack on rashes 2-3 times a day. Hope your concern has been resolved. Get Well Soon. Best Wishes,"
