  "Q": "I have a dimple on my breast.  It did not show up on my last mammogram.  My primary care doctor said she does not think it could be cancer, but I have been doing my research and am concerned that I need more tests to determine what exactly it is.  Can you please advise me on what tests I should request my doctor to run?",
  "A": "Hi ! Good afternoon. I am Chat Doctor answering your query. As per your history, you need a detailed physical examination by a general surgeon of the breast and maxilla. Apart from that you should also go for a repeat mammogram me. If all are normal, then it needs close observation, and might need an excision biopsy in case of increase in size. I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in planning your treatment. Thanks for using the Chat Doctor forum for your query on health. Wishing you an early recovery. Chat Doctor."
