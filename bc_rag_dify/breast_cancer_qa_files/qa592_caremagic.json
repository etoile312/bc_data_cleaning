  "Q": "I had two breast lumps taken out years ago....both benign....went on tomoxifen to prevent breast cancer for 5 years.  I am now 5 years in menopause (surgically)....am 49 years old.  Where the old incisions are, Im suddenly feeling a pulling sensation and tingling.  Im due for my mammogram on Oct. 1st.  Last year I was called back for a repeat due to architectural distortion.  The second mammogram was cleared.  My surgeon cleared me.  Im worried about these sensations since my sister got breast cancer at 40 and died at 45.",
  "A": "Hi, Thanks for writing in. It is important to get breast ultrasound done to assess the area under the skin where the lumps were earlier present. This can help to know of any recurrent lumps or an infection in the area. Post-operative healing and scar formation also causes tingling and pulling sensation. Ultrasound uses sound waves to get a picture of the structures under the skin. It is radiation free and an easy method of breast evaluation recommended for all ages. Please consult the surgeon who operated and removed the lumps in your breast a year back. Get yourself examined clinically and clear doubts of any suspicious cancer by getting ultrasound scan for both the breasts and axillary regions and most likely it will be normal. Please do not worry."
