  "Q": "I am Braca negative, but have had 2 cases of breast cancer, nodes were clean---my daughter died of lymphoma at 22, My mother also had breast cancer--- I had AML at 53, ---both cancers were removed lumpectomy & radiation, and were small in size. I faithfully do yrly exams. !st cancer was treated w/ tomoxifen, 2nd. one is treated w/ letrozole. 1st BC at 50 and most recent one 2012. Both my cancers are est. & prog positive. Should I have a hysterectomy now as a preventive??",
  "A": "The tamoxifen has documented side effect of causing uterine cancer in later time. So usually I follow Ultrasound test to know the uterine wall thickness. If it is increasing in size then I suggest undergoing for hysterectomy. The hysterectomy also comes with some unwanted effects. So usually it is not advisable to go Prophylactic Hysterectomy. But as you mentioned the incidences of cancer in your family, you may go for hysterectomy if you are fit for surgery."
