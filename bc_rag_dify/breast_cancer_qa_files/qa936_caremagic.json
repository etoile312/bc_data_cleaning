  "A": "Hi, High prolactin level has no relation with breast cancer. Family history of germ cell tumor has no relation with breast cancer. You have not mentioned your age. If you are not pregnant it will be better to go for a mammography. BIRDS scoring will better identify the possibility of benign breast disease or malignancy. Nothing to worry right now. Breast ultrasound can also give you some information. Follow your doctors advise. Take care."
