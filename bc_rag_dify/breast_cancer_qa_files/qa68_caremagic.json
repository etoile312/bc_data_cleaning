I also had a result of 9 on a vitamin D blood test. My liver test results also say I had a 4 for my bilirubin. Should i be worried? Im 29 yr old female. 167 lbs.",
  "A": "Hello and welcome to Chat Doctor. Thank you for your query. Yes, there are a couple of things you should be worried about here. Let us first shed some light on the urobilinogen. The causes for elevated levels of urobilinogen (bilirubin in the urine)are:-Liver diseases-Bile duct obstruction-HepatitisAs you have also an elevated serum bilirubin of 4 (whether total or direct), this indicates some abnormality with the liver. Please conduct an ultrasound of the abdomen and pelvis and also check other parameters in your liver function test. Also, it is important to note that your vitamin D levels are very low. The normal levels are 20-56 NG/ml or 50-140 MOL/L. Levels below 32 NG/ml are considered to be low, and a level below 20 NG/ml can cause serious conditions and predispose to conditions like breast cancer. Please meet your doctor at the earliest and initiate vitamin D injections at the earliest. I hope I have succeeded in providing the information you were looking for. Please feel free to write back to me for any further clarifications. I would gladly help you. Best wishes."
