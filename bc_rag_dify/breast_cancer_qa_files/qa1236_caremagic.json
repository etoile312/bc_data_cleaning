  "Q": "This question concerns my mother in law:She is a 71 year old woman, and she is a smoker. 2 years ago, she had breast cancer, but it was cured through radiation therapy. This February she was diagnosed with cholangiocarcinoma. She has been following chemotherapy treatment since April to October. The liquid in the bile duct has reduced, but there are still lesions on the liver, it is inflamed, and there are now lesions on the spleen. The oncologist said that a resection was out of the question, so he is trying a new drug combo of Irinotecan 180mg, Folinique Acid  400mg and Fluorouracil 400mg and 46 hours of Fluorouracil 2400mg followed by a week of rest. During all of the previous treatment, she has had very low haemoglobin and platelets. My husband and I would like to know a rough estimate as to the prognosis, as our oncologist seems to go back and forth with his answers, so we are seeking a second opinion.",
  "A": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your mother in laws situation and problem. Since she is having lesions in liver and spleen, she is having stage 4 cancer. And only palliative treatment in the form of chemotherapy and nutritional supplements is advisable. Life expectancy in such cases is less than 2 years. Five year survival rate is approximately 40-50%. If nutritional support is better than survival rate also improves. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wishing good health to your mother-in-law. Thanks."
