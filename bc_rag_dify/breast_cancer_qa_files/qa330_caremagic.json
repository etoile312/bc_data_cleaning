  "Q": "I had a mammogram done last August. 2 days after the mammogram I was at my doctor s with severe upper back pain that would radiate under my right breast. We did physical therapy - didn t work. Pain killers didn t work. He then sent me to the pain clinic. I had a steroid injection in my spine done. Pain was gone for six months. Now it s back. Had another injection a month ago. It doesn t seem to be working this time. The pain usually occurs in the middle of the night . It wakes me up. I can usually sit for a hour on the sofa and it will calm down. Sometimes that doesn t work. Standing helps. It is interfering with my sleep. Have I damaged a nerve, if so, what can I do? Will it eventually heal?",
  "A": "Howell come to ChatDoctorI really appreciate your concern, in my opinion first thing is to know the underlying cause of pain if it is not being investigated then better to get dome the CT imaging and increasing the tolerance power for pain, better avoid taking steroid preparation, try to maintain good posture, try relaxation therapy, \"Tab Chlorzoxazone can be tried\" three times in day, hope this information helps, take care."
