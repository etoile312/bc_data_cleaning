  "Q": "Hi Doctor, I am having cough from past 2 years. My mother as well as brother also having cough. I used to clear my through regularly. After food I feel to cough and clear my throat. Please help me for a suggesion. I took Xray that time its was ok. Doctore gave GERD medicine. But there was no change. Now also I used to cough in AC,while bathing, while walking.....etc.",
  "A": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your situation and problem. By your history and description, I think you are having cough variant asthma. Points in favor of this are1. Positive family history in mother and brother2. Chest x-ray was normal, so infection has been ruled out.3. Chronic symptoms, not improved with routine Chat Doctor. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done PFT (pulmonary function test) to rule out cough variant asthma. You may need inhaled bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) for control."
