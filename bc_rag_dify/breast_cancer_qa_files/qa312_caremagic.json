  "Q": "Hi... I have been suffering with an Acute Respiratory Infection for several weeks, and have taken a full course of Amoxycillan (500). My breathing is a lot better, albeit still a little strained. My concern is that I am still feeling a little dizzy and breathless at times, and very exhasuted and I have an intermittant burning sensation that keeps coming duting the day around my left chest area. I can still feel on the left side that things arent as they should be, but there is a big improvement. The breast area on the left feels very bruised, particularly around the side and underside. If I press the underside it feels lumpy and as if I have been kicked. I have re called my Doctor and he has said that it is the aftermath of a bad infection. I just would like reassurance, and any advise as to how to speed up the healing process? The right breast is slightly sensitive at the right side, but nothing like the left. I am wondering whether the milk ducts in the breast area coulod have become blocked or infected? I finished breast feeding 12 months ago? I am also experiences intermittant tingling in my hands, which I have had since my first cold symptoms in January. Any advise is much appreciated. Thanks.",
  "A": "Hello rearward welcome to Chat Doctor.come have evaluated your query thoroughly.* This seems in relation with underlying lung inflammation still present, not blockage of mammary ducts or else.* Recommendations for better recovery - Ask for an x-ray chest with your doctor, and lab tests if not done.  As you require further antibiotics and bronchi dilators to cover the condition early.- Regular walking in fresh air, deep breathing exercises, YOGA will help tremendously.- Avoid smoking or alcohol if using.- Avoid exposure to excess cold, atmosphere with pollen, dust.- Balanced nutritious diet. Hope this will help you for sure. Regards dear take care."
