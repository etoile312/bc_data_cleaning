  "Q": "My mom has met bone cancer from breast located in her pelvis and femur.  Treatment has been steroids which seemed to have eased her pain  now started aromycin to ease off steroids.  However, she was taking zyprexa for anxiety (long time ADO patient) but because of bad symptoms they switched to Buspar (milder).  However, after 2 weeks she has now become somewhat catatonic and disoriented and has a lot of trouble speaking.  Doc says its the cancer and we should speak to hospice.  But she was a very much different, pleasant and communicating person 3 weeks ago.  We think its the meds because of the dramatic change.  Your thoughts ?",
  "A": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your situation and problem. There are few possibilities in your mothers' case for her symptoms like disorientation, catatonia and decreased speech. 1. Brain metastasis 2. Electrolyte disturbance 3. Acute psychosis due to cancer. So first get done MRI brain to rule out brain metastasis, as breast cancer commonly spreads to brain. If this is normal, then get done Electrolyte levels. If both are normal then she is having acute psychosis due to cancer (terminal disease). So consult psychiatrist and get done counseling sessions. She may need additional Chat Doctor. "
