  "Q": "I have been experiencing some intermittent pain in a weird location. It is a diagonal pain, above left breast, and heads toward left shoulder. Pain extends about 6 inches. I ve had some chiropractic because I thought it might be related to my cervical spine, and it goes away for a short period of time but then always returns. I had an adjustment today, and the pain was gone for about 5 hours, but it is back again now. It is not sharp, or constant, but feels kind of like a muscle pulling. If I turn my head tot the right, it definitely exacerbates the feeling. I haven t had any injuries. I m 53, good blood pressure, pulse, no diseases other than degenerative disc disease which is causing me lots of pain in my lower back and SI joint areas.",
  "A": "Hello, The location and movement of pain give clues as to what is going on. Localized and outside the chest would simply a small area.  While in theory breast cancer could cause that, the more common cause of breast local trauma, pulling down on nearby structures with age and sagging, bra fitting wrongly is of course more common. Nevertheless, every over 50 women should have a yearly mammogram and that would also show infection/tumors other than cancer/cysts/scar. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Take care Chat Doctor. "
