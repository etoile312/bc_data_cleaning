  "Q": "Im a 37 year old female, 54 & 295lbs. I was diagnosed with HER 2 positive breast cancer last year. I had 6 rounds of Chemo and have been doing Herceptin since Oct 2010. I had a partial masectomy in April 2011. I have recently found a lump in the left breast but have been told not to worry that it is probably just a cyst. I was also told the same thing last year. Should I get a second opinion.",
  "A": "Hi! Thanks for writing to us sharing your health problem! After going through your problem of lump in the left breast following partial mastectomy and chemotherapy for HER-2-NEU positive breast cancer, I must consider following possibilities:1. A benign cystic lesion could be fibrotic changes in the breast tissue2. Some low grade chronic infection3. Hematoma or suture granuloma4. cancerous just need a needle biopsy for confirmation which is itself a kind of second and final opinion; please ask your treating doctor today about this and revert to us with feedback. Regards,"
