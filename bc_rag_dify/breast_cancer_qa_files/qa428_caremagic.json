  "Q": "My friend has had a radical mastectomy and there is remaining cancer on the surface level of her skin where the keyloided(sp) scars are.  A hole was burned in her chest from radiation treatments and the would is still open.  I dont have faith in her current treatments and wondered what we can do to help first heal the cancer and then regrow skin in the area where it is affected.",
  "A": "HelloWelcome to Chat Doctor Sorry to hear about your condition. If there is remaining cancer in chest wall after surgery, then the outcome is poor. However, if the hole/scar is cancer free she can expect good outcome. Regarding the wound after radiation, it heals very slowly. I am good plastic surgeon can help in this condition. But again for plastic surgical procedure like flaps, the chest wall scar should be cancer free. Regards"
