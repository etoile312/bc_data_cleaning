  "Q": "I am currently 2 years and 4 months free of breast cancer(lumpectomy) and had a hysterectomy in January at which time they changed my Tamoxifen to Arimidex. I have over the past few months been experiencing severe foot (heel) pain when standing and walking along with numbess in my arms and fingers which my fingers are very difficult to move in the morning. Most recently I noticed my ankes are very swollen and appear to be bruised looking.",
  "A": "Dear Sir/Madam have gone through your query and read your symptoms. In my opinion, you need screening for arthritis, a battery of blood tests will help ascertain your diagnosis. Moreover the numbness in hands and feet could stem from the fact that you would be developing peripheral neuropathy, both things can be sort out, so do not panic and relax, talk to your physician about this and let him investigate you. I hope that answers your query. If you want any more clarification, contact me back."
