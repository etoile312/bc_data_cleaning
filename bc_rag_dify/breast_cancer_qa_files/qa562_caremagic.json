  "Q": "my mother had breast cancer years ago so i am considered high risk.i had my regular mammogram done a week ago and my dr called me in to say i had a lump in my right breast and it has dissapeared and they now want to give me an ultrasound to further investigate .My dr is a man of few words lol but where did this lump go ia my question?",
  "A": "Hi, Its unlikely for a lump to disappear. How big was the lump to begin with? Was it picked up in clinical examination or in Mammography? What is your present age? Answers to these questions would guide me to better understand the problem. I suggest you get a repeat Mammogram done as per the screening protocol and see another Doctor. If not, you can ask us a Direct or a Specialist query along with the details I asked. Take care, Chat Doctor. "
