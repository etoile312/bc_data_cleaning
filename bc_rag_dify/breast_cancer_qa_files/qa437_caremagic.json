  "A": "Hi, Thanks for the query.  I understand your concern.  Today she is already overdue for her periods by 5 days. Wait for 3 days more & the purchase home pregnancy kit from market for her. Test her urine sample after 8 days of delay in her periods. Pregnancy test of urine by the time may turn +ve, if she is pregnant.  The pill are to be taken within 72 hours of unprotected sex. If she is pregnant. Consult a doctor & go for medical termination of pregnancy.  Thanks."
