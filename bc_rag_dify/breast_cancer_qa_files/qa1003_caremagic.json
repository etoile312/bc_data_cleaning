  "A": "Welcome to Chat Doctor .1. It should be around 2-3 days according to me after removal of the lymph nodal mass. And revisit for the followup Chat Doctor. 2. After that you have to wait for the biopsy result, and evaluate the cause for the lymph nodal enlargement.3. In females mostly the underlying cause could be breasted - which needs to be evaluated (if females). Get an ultrasound examination of breast and axillary region, If nothing found even a mammogram may be helpful.4. Recomment to take good post-operative care. Hope it helps you. Wish you a good health. Anything to ask ? Do not hesitate. Thank you."
