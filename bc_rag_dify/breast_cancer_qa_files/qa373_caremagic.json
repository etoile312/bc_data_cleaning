  "Q": "I am a 55 year old woman. Last Friday at around 5:00 in the morning I fell over a wagon in the yard. I had a swollwn contusion on the inside of my right leg that is now just a bruise. Okay here is my question. When I got to work later that morning I lifted my right arm and a burning shoot pain from my arm pit to the side of my right breast. It still hurts and sometimes when I move my arm a certain way or step hard that pain comes back. I have looked at about 6 cancer websites and I show no syptoms of breast cancer but I am still concerned. I hoping I just pulled a muscle or something. There is no bruising in that area.",
  "A": "Had it been any lump of that magnitude in the breast, you could have palpated it. There are more chances of muscle pull. Pour some hot water and massage a muscle relaxant mentally. For early recovery, if you can put 1/2 tsp turmeric powder in warm milk or water and take daily once or twice. Its tasteless, safe, natural anti-inflammatory and analgesic spice. No harm. Not toxic unlike Chat Doctor. If you do not like, may take Hard"
