  "Q": "My Aunt has just been diagnosed (this past week) with Liver Cancer, though not yet sure of stage.  She is 83, 198 lbs (lost 7 lbs in last two weeks), is a 20 + yr breast cancer survivor and in overall OK health.  She was having trouble digesting food, so I took her to Dr.  They then found a tumor in her upper abdomen.  Blood work, CT and endoscopy done (nothing detected in the endoscopy).  The Dr. reached out to me last night (great Dr. - called on a Friday night @ 9:00!) to let me know to be ready for an oncology appt for his upcoming week.  What can I potentially expect?  All that I read tells me that we should be ready for a short life expectancy....  Anything I should know?  Would chemo be an option for someone like this?",
  "A": "Hi and welcome to Chat Doctor. All in all these aren't good news. It is questionable is this primary liver tumor or a metastasis. But whatever it is she is definitely not able to stand liver resection or any other surgical procedure. Chemo is also questionable. But you should give your best for palliative treatment and make all this easier for her. It is hard to predict anything but life expectancy is from few months till 1 year if this is malignant. Wish you good luck."
