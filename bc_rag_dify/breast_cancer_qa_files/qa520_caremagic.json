  "A": "Hi ! Good evening. I am Chat Doctor answering your query. The symptoms you described are not necessarily be due to a cancer. Many benign breast diseases like fibroadenoma and fibroadenomas could also give rise to such clinical features. The shoulder and neck pain could be an independent symptom of yours not related to the breast problem. If I were your doctor, I would perform a clinical examination of your breasts along with the axillary regions, followed by a mammography and FNAC/excision biopsy of the lesions you have described. Further management would depend on the investigation reports. I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem. Please do not hesitate to ask in case of any further doubts. Thanks for choosing Chat Doctor to clear doubts on your health problems. Wishing you an early recovery. Chat Doctor."
