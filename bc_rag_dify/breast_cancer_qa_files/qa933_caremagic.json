  "Q": "Hi, I am 34yrs old. I have a hard pea size lump on my left breast which is toward the middle rather than the outer side, (I would call it 11 o clock if 3 o clock were toward my left side). It feels farely close to the surface but deeper than a cystic pimple does. The skin over it is slightly darker (pinker) than the rest. I have no history of lumps, no breast cancer history in my family, no children & I finished my last period three days ago. Do you have any thoughts on this?",
  "A": "Hi.it is best if you consult with a doctor, preferably a general surgeon in regard to your concern. It may be any of the following benign breast lesions: cystic, fibroid or fibrotic changes. Other tumor types, such as malignancy, must also be ruled-out. Clinical evaluation is best. Diagnostics (such as breast ultrasound and/or mammography, tissue biopsy) may be recommended. Management (medical and/or surgical) will be directed accordingly. Hope this helps. Good day!!~ Chat Doctor. "
