  "Q": "Hi there, I am 9 days post embryo transfere. Before the transfere, i had tender breasts probably due to the meds. On day 8 after transfere, the tenderness has started to disappear!? Today, day 9 there is almost no tenderness. I have had very mild cramping right from the start. My question is .... if breast tenderness is disappearing, is it most likely that i am not pregnant? Ps. This was a donor egg IVF. I have 4 days to go until my pregnancy test and I am getting very stressed!!! Hope you can help. Many thanks indeed. Pippa",
  "A": "Hi Chat Doctor user, yes you are right breast tenderness after and before transfer is due to medications. Don't worry it doesn't mean that your cycle is failed. Be positive and focused it can be positive also sometimes low level of progesterone can lead to such symptoms. You can empirically increase dose of the progesterone in order to increase chances of implemention. Please don't discontinue any medicines unless pregnancy test report is negative."
