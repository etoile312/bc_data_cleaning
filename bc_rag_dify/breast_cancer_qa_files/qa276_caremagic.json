  "Q": "My sister had Breast cancer and her cancer was removed, later she found she had ulcers and they gave her meds for that shortly she found she had a 10 cm tumors removed that was pressing on her stomach and she lost 80 pounds last year they remove her kidney, she has been on chemo  and then found she had cancer on her spine and was given radition and has taken 4 treatments of chemo. She has been complaing of being constipated and today she says she is bleeding from her rectum. She is due for an scan in 4 days to see if there is any change, We both are afraid she has stomach cancer. I am hoping it is ulcer. But if she has more cancer spreading, what is her outcome and how soon?...",
  "A": "Dear Annalist, Breast cancer is metalized to spine most commonly. As she had been on chemotherapy and radiotherapy, it might be due to chemo induced and tradition induced enterocolitis or parotitis. As mentioned constipation, it also could be due to the internal hemorrhoids. So it would be better to have stool examination with occult blood and colonoscopy or photocopy and endoscopy for the cause of bleeding."
