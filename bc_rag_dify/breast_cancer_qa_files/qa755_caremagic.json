  "Q": "My mom had undergone lump removal surgery in axilla. Biopsy report shows that it is CLEAR CELL CARCINOMA. After surgery within 15 days doctor suggested to go for blood test and CT scan. Blood test & CT scan shows everything is normal and no evidence of cancer cells. So should we proceed with the further treatment of cancer like radiation or treatment is not required because everything is normal ? After surgery, other than biopsy report, which test will confirm cancer detection. And doctor told to remove left side breast as it would have spread. Reports are normal. Then why should we go for removal surgery ? Can you please suggest what to do now?",
  "A": "Hi and welcome to Chat Doctor, thank you for your query.it doesn't matte rift here is no ct evidence of recurrence since breast cancer may spread microscopically and usual treatment protocol in this cancer is a bit more aggressive than in other ones. Decision is up to you but radio and removal of all possible involved tissue will rule out possibility of recurrence no matter how strange this sounds to you.  Wish you good health. Regards."
