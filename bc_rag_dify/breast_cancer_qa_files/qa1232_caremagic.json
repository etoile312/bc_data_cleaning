  "Q": "Hello, I had my regular mammogram two weeks ago and was called back for a diagnostic last week. i This showed a few small cancer cells in my right breast. The radiologist spoke to the doctor who said come back for another diagnostic in six months. It has been 6 days and I am worried sick, I don t know if I will make it through 6 months.............. no history of breast cancer, or indeed cancer in family. I had a benign cyst removed from left breast in 1998. Panic, should I panic, should I relax and wait 6 months?",
  "A": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your situation and problem. But no need to worry much for cancer. As mammography is only a screening test. It is not the diagnostic test for breast cancer. So if any suspicious lesion is found which is not able to hit by needle, then follow-up mammography after 6 months is advised to see for any change in lesion. So don't worry, be relaxed and calm and get done follow-up mammography after 6 months."
