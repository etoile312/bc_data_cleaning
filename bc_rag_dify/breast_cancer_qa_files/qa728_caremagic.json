  "Q": "Hi, I have been booked for my lower wisdom tooth to be removed and am petrified from what what I have read. Both wisdom tooth partial coming out but the right side is coming outwards. It is not causing pain but the gum can feel bit swollen sometimes and there isnt much room, hence it put pressure on my lower front teeth causing movement. On lower right side my 1st molar is broken and had root canal few years back and require crown but cant afford at moment and wonder if its worth removing this molar instead of the wisdom tooth to make space and how likely is it that the gap will be closed by the wisdom tooth or if at all.",
  "A": "Hi. Welcome to Chat Doctor. I read your query. On right side as you mentioned the wisdom tooth is impinging the front tooth, it may lead to cavity and pain in front tooth. This may further need RCT and crown of the tooth in front of wisdom tooth if not take out in time. On left side, why would you prefer taking out an already RCT treated molar? The wisdom tooth is impacted, so it won't move enough to cause the closure of space from removal of molar in front. Also, you mentioned of swelled gums around wisdom teeth, which means peritonitis, i.e. there is already infection around wisdom teeth. I suggest you to get both the wisdom tooth extraction and restoration of teeth in front of them. The RCT treated molar needs crown as RCT weekend the tooth, and it can break under mastectomy force. If not at the moment, get a crown over it. Till then avoiding batting hard things from that side. Maintain oral hygiene. Do warm saline rinses. Hope the answer helps you. Thank you."
