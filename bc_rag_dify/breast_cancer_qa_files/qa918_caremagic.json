  "A": "Hello, I have gone through your query and understand your concern.1. As he had lacuna infarct stroke, she is at high risk of getting new stroke or extension of previous infarct. This may be due to Repeated Transient Ischemic Attacks (TIA).TIA lasts for few minutes to hours and recovery with in 24 hours thus please do CT and MRI brain to detect any new infarct.2. She may have Cardiovascular disease. Please check her blood pressure. In addition, she needs complete cardiac evaluation Electrocardiogram, Echocardiogram and Treadmill test. Then consult your treating Physician for further management. Hope this helps. Please write back for further queries. Wishing you good health."
