  "Q": "I have a lump in my breast. it has been there about 2 yrs and has grown in size. recently I discovered a smaller lump beneath it which is very painful. I have also had green discharge. could it be a clogged milk duct? or cancer? I have had 2 mammograms in the past 2 yrs. but wasn t told anything abnormal was found.",
  "A": "Hello and welcome to Chat Doctor, A lump in breast along with green colored discharge suggests a duct Eurasia. Green colored discharge is very characteristic of duct Eurasia. Dict Eurasia IA dilation of mammary duct and collection of discharge in the duct. Surgical excision of the duct is the definitive treatment of duct Eurasia. I suggest you to consult your primary healthcare provider for clinical assessment, duct radiography and thus treatment. Thanks and take care Chat Doctor. "
