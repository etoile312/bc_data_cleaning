  "Q": "Can you tell from a ultrasound examination if you do not have cancer. My screening showed 3 lumps and I was told it is a hypoechoic lesion consistent with a fatty lobule.  I am still worried as I have a family history of breast cancer. I was told to come back in two years. Diagnosis. Benign breast changes.  Kind regards Soynia",
  "A": "Hi, thanks for calling Chat Doctor forum.  It is the primary examination, it can't give diagnosis, but can exclude malignancy. If some features are not seen like vascularity pattern, etc. they exclude the malignancy. If present proceed for biopsy, and mammogram etc. As there are benign changes, they called after 2 years, to see whether there is transformation of benign tissues to malignant changes.  Wishing for a positive health. Thank you."
