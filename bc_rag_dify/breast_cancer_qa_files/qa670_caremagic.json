  "A": "Hello.thanks for trusting the Chat Doctor doctors for your health related issues. As u told that u had sex on 11th June, it is the safe period of your wife, so there is very less chance of getting pregnancy and your wife already had taken unwanted pill within 72 hours of unprotected sex then u people already had taken double protection, so don't worry. Relax.there is rare chance of getting pregnancy. Just wait for the menses to come. If u people are still worried then visit nearby gynecologist, he/she can help you."
