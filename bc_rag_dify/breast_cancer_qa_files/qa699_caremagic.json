  "Q": "Hello,Im a 43 year old woman. I have anemia, its at 9.8 and a sed rate of 70.  I have had a colonoscopy and endoscopy to see if Im bleeding internally. It showed I had polyps in my fundus. They were removed. I also just had my 2nd mammogram, now I need a biopsy. I have joint pain, mainly my back and one side of my neck. My Rheaumatologist suggest I keep seeing my Hematologist to check for cancer because she could not detect an autoimmune disease. Could it be cancer of fibromyalgia?",
  "A": "Hello and welcome to Chat Doctor, The cause of anemia should be sought. A complete hologram with RBC indices should be done. In case the anemia is due to nutritional deficiency, you should take supplements. Iron deficiency anemia is common among menstruating females. A polyp in the funds region can be the cause of excessive bleeding. If the symptoms are very troublesome, the uterus can be surgically removed if you have completed your family. What are the results of biopsy? If any lump is detected on mammography, a fine needle aspiration needs to be done. Further management will depend on the results of aspiration results. What is the result of colonoscopy? A sedimentation rate of 70 mm in 1st hour suggests a chronic disease process in the body. Kindly post your colonoscopy report. No history mentioned by you does not suggest blood cancer. Thanks and take care Chat Doctor. "
