  "Q": "Hello, so feb 18 i had unprotected sex 6 days later i got my period (my cycle is about 21-24 days long but very irregular). I had unprotected sex on feb 26 (day after my period), march 10, and 12. today is march 15 and i took a pregnancy test and it came out negative. I feel sick quite a bit, i feel rather bloated, my breasts have slightly enlarged, what i would really like to know is if you think i am pregnant",
  "A": "Hello, and I hope I can help you today. If you are having unprotected sex, there is always a possibility you can become pregnant. However, pregnancy symptoms can vary a lot between women, and even the stress of worrying about pregnancy can make your menstrual cycle irregular. And breast tenderness, feeling bloated and tired can all be premenstrual symptoms. The only way to be sure if you are pregnant is to wait for your period to come, and if it does not on time, take a pregnancy test.  It will not become positive until at least 3 weeks after conception. I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today and that this information was helpful. Best wishes, "
