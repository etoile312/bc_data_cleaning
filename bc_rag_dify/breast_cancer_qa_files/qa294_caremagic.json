  "Q": "my mother in law had operated for breast cancer some 4 years back. after radiation and chemotherapy she has developed tumor on shoulder, physician has advised 30mg morphine 6 times a day.can yoy explain the condition of the patient?  she is suffering from pain",
  "A": "Hi, Thanks for writing in. It will help to know the entire disease and treatment history in details. It is possible that there is a new tumor that has developed in the shoulder or there effects of radiation or chemotherapy which is giving her the pain. Cancer is a difficult disease to treat, and the manifestations might be different in every patient. It is possible that in your mother-in-law, there is a tumor that is infiltrating the nerve supply to the arm or the nerves are getting pinched due to the chemotherapy and radiation effects. The main cancer and any spread to nearby areas is important when we discuss the condition of the patient. If she is not having any recurrent cancer in the operated area, opposite breast or the arm and shoulder then her condition can be called stable. Pain varies with every patient and appearance of pain can also be due to a benign cause in the absence of any cancer activity after treatment. Please do not worry."
