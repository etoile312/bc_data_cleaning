  "Q": "I had protected sex 3 weeks ago... and don t really have symptoms...but I have been pooping a lot, really gassy, and have had some breast tenderness. I take my pill every day at the same time, and waited the 7 days before having sex (with a condom). Is there still a chance I could be pregnant?",
  "A": "Hello dear. Understand your concern. Birth control pills failure rate is 1-2 %, means 100 women's used it then 1-2 women he chance to be pregnant. If you take regularly pills then lesser than less chance to be pregnant, & you said that you are doing protected sex, so you doubly protected, so,according to me 99.99% you he no chance to be pregnant. Your symptoms are may be due to indigestion & Brest tenderness is due to side effects of contraceptive pills. So be calm, not worrying or being an anxious. Hope this will help you. Best regards. Chat Doctor. "
