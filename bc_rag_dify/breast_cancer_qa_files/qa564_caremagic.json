  "Q": "My 13 year old daughter has recently informed me that her breasts are slightly lumpy. She said it hurts around the nipple area and it feels like there are small pebbles when she moves her finger around the breast in a circular motion. She has gotten her period (March of this year), and she is a perfectly healthy child, but should I be worried about the lumps she claims to feel? Thank You, Katy",
  "A": "Hi. I've gone through your query. I can understand your anxiety. Breast lumps in case of your daughter could be a BREAST BUD as she is growing up or focal modularity (area of thickened breast tissue) which is evident before her periods, or it could be fibroadenoma advice you consult your doctor for breast examination, for a chest USG & a mammogram if needed Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Take care.  "
