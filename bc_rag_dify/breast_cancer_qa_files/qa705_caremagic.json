  "Q": "My daughter who is 28 yrs old went for a mamagram as she has had a swollen lymph node under her arm for 3-4 weeks. At the mamagram she was told it looked suspicious and was considered a B-4 ? and to go for a biopsy. My question is what does that mean suspicious and a B-4? Any help would be appreciated. Thanks,",
  "A": "BIRDS is a score given to Demographically visualized lumps or lesions and given a score from 0 to 6 with chances of cancer being present in the lump increasing as the score increases. 0 means incomplete assessment. 1 and 2 are negative for cancer. 3 means low chances of 2% of having breast cancer. 4 is suspicious with 20 to 35% chances of cancer. 5 is 95% chance of cancer. 6 means already proven cancer by pathologist. So in your case as the score is 4 yours is a suspicious lesion. Please go ahead with the biopsy at the earliest. Treatment can later be tailored depending on the report. You can let me know the report by asking a question on my profile page or by using the Ask a Specialist section of the site. Take care.  Chat Doctor. "
