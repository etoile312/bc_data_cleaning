  "Q": "Hi I have had malignant melanoma 10 years ago with multiple mole biopsies, breast cancer with treatment three years ago, uterine cancer witChatDoctorplete hysterectomy two years ago. Since my cancer, I now have high blood pressure treated with medication, hypothyroidism treated with medication and B12 injections. Most recently, I noticed a lump on my lower back/spine area. My doctor said to watch it; she thought it felt spongy and may need to be biopsied if it continues to grow. Should I wait or have it done immediately?",
  "A": "Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. You have history of malignant melanoma, breast cancer and uterine cancer. Now you have lump. It can be soft tissue tumor, or it can be metastatic tumor from any of your malignancy. You should not wait. Go for biopsy of that lump. It will give you exact diagnosis. Then you should take treatment accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have any doubts then contact me at bit.ly/ Chat Doctor. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health."
