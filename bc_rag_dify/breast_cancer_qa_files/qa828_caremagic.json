  "Q": "my mother has stage 4 breast cancer with liver metastases and skeletal metastases and lymph nodal involvement, the doctors have given hope . right now she is under palliative care takes morphine 5mg and dulcalax and perinorm. she is also with jaundice her bilirubin level is high is there a way we can reduce the bilirubin level for her .",
  "A": "Dear friend, i can understand the pain you and your family must be going through. I wish we could do something better for her. I think the best way to deal with the bilirubin issue here is to investigate the cause of elevated bilirubin. Plz consult a hepatologist/physician for knowing the cause of the elevated bilirubin. Relevant tests would be specific bilirubin levels, urobilinogen, liver enzyme assays, prothrombin time and ultrasound of liver to begin with to see what is causing the liver to not properly get rid of bilirubin. Do let me know if you have any more questions."
