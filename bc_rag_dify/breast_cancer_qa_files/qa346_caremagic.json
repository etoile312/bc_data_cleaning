The pain is lot. Can tell me the reson?",
  "A": "Hi dear, I have gone through your question and understand the concerns.1. Both hypothyroidism and PCs are causes of an ovulation and hence inability to conceive. Therefore, if these two conditions are properly treated, then the chances of conception are increased. You can try to conceive with these medications.2. Breast pain is unrelated to the thyroid medication. It can be due to fibroadenomas. Consult a surgeon for proper examination and treatment accordingly. Hope you found the answer helpful. Regards Chat Doctor. "
