  "Q": "A good friend of mine was recently diagnosed with PMCA Stage IV.  She had one large tumor removed from underneath her left breast and has lots of small ones through abdomen.  In your opinion, is it worth going through chemo, or in Stage IV, has it spread so far, that chemo will not buy her much more time?",
  "A": "Good morning. I understand your concern. Even in stage 4 breast cancer, some patients may live up to 5 years or so depending upon the tumor burden and receptor status of tumor (ER PR HER-2.new). So it is difficult to predict the survival without any reports of these tests. You need to consult your doctor for these tests. Only after these test appropriate chemotherapy and other targeted therapy can be planned for her. Regards"
