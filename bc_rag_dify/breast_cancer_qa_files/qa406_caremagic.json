  "A": "Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. She has multiple loci of brain tumor. Surgery will not work in that case. Radiotherapy and chemotherapy can be given, but it will not cure the disease. Despite all treatment chances of survival is very low. Prognosis and life expectancy is not good at all. Sorry to say but it is fact. One should not expect much from this. Hope I have answered your question, if you have any doubts then contact me at bit.ly/ Chat Doctor. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health."
