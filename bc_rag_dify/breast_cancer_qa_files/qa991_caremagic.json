  "Q": "Hi I am a 37year old female.  Last month I noticed two soft lumps in my breast.  I got a mammogram and an ultrasound done, botChatDoctore back negative.  The radiologist said the lumps were fat lobules and no further testing or treatment is needeed.  I dont feel comfortable with the lumps in my breast.  My PCP said not to worry and refused to do a biopsy.  Should I get a second opinion?  My mammogram report says my breast are dense and that a BB was placed by the lump.  Im worried.... any advice would be appreciated.",
  "A": "Hi. Thanks for your query and an elucidated history. I can understand your level of worry in spite of two Doctor and Mammography have assured you. Well, this is the best policy to have a second opinionCertainly FNAC- (fine needle aspiration cytology)could have been performed. Many times the fat necrosis mimic the same picture you have. So do not worry please, go for second opinion and insist for FNAC. This will give you sound mind. All the best."
