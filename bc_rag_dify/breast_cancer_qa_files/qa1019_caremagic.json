  "Q": "My lymphatic system shut down about 6 yrs ago. I have a lot of pain and swelling. Saw a dermatologist last week and she did skin biopsy on my wrist and inner thigh- suspects cancer. I had mascetomy in 1999. Is lymphono cancer one of my symptons. I dont have anything to help fight infections. Could these signs be lymphono cancer?Im scared because since having breast cancer I have not had any energy, stay tired all the time. Any info. would be appreciated.",
  "A": "Hi and welcome to Chat Doctor, thank you for your query. It may be lymphoma, but it has to be confirmed by biopsy. You didn't mention what exactly this previous biopsy showed. If this is just skin cancer then I don't think this is related to your risk of lymphoma. So your lack of energy probably isn't sign of new cancer.it can be signed of various other diseases. Lymphomas can be also ruled out by certain blood tests and sternal function. Wish you good health. Regards."
