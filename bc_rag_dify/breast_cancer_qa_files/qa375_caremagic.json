  "Q": "I am 50 yearsold. I had a hysterectomy about 10 years ago. My uterus was removed and cervix and ovaries left because of my age. In the last few weeks I have been have pressure in the lower abdomnin and thought I was getting a UTI. Test were negative. I had noticed also a discharge and odor also and was told I had a yeast infection and given a an antibiotic for that. however, I still have discharge and lighter odor. I was also have breast pain during this time. Doc has done a ultra sound on ovaries and hormone blood test. Question: is there other things that can cause these symptoms like the discharge, pressure, etc?",
  "A": "Hi ! Good afternoon. I am Chat Doctor answering your query. I hope your gynecologist must have performed a P/V examination of yours to rule out a prolapse of post hysterectomy vaginal vault, which is not uncommon. This could also give rise to the Chat Doctor.  Not infrequently post op adhesions of the remaining pelvic organs could also give rise to pressure symptoms in the lower abdomen. Results of clinical assessment and reports of related investigations would decide on further management your problem. I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem. Please do not hesitate to ask in case of any further doubts. Thanks for choosing Chat Doctor to clear doubts on your health problems. Wishing you an early recovery. Chat Doctor"
