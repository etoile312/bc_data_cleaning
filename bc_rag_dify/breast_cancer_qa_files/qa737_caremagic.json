  "Q": "hello. I have a fungus problem in the groin since a week and three days, I read some articles, and Im sure its the jock itch (tinea cruris). I want to know if the Dettol soap may help in the treatment, and if it will go away only with Dettol. I cant go to a doctor, I have my reasons. Suggestions?",
  "A": "Hello and welcome to Chat Doctor Closely opposing body folds e.g. finger webs, upper inner thighs, groin, maxilla, submammary folds etc. can trap sweat, heat and moisture, therefore making the area favorable for fungal proliferation. If I was the treating doctor I would have asked you to use a topical antifungal like clotrimazole cream, twice daily, regularly for 4 weeks. One such cream that you can use is Candid-B cream, twice daily for 4 weeks. For the thigh and groin area. I would also suggest an oral antifungal e.g. fluconazole 150 mg once weekly for 4-6 weeks for a more complete urban OTC antihistamine e.g. cetirizine 10 mg once daily would help you in symptomatic itch relief. An Antifungal dusting powder e.g. clotrimazole dusting powder can also be used throughout the summers, it would not only keep the folds Chat Doctor. Thank you."
