  "A": "Hi.your aunt probably has metastasis from her breast cancer already. If your aunt is on chemotherapeutic agents, the symptoms she's experiencing right now might be secondary to those medications which are expected. During chemotherapy, her immune system is expected to weaken. During this stage, precautions must be observed as she is more prone to infection and illness. But after the chemo-treatment, her immune system will eventually bounce back. Please advise her to continue eating on time even if it seems she has no appetite as proper nutrition would be of great help during her treatment process. A referral to a clinical nutritionist would also be of great help. Keep strong and praying. Hope this helps.- Chat Doctor. "
