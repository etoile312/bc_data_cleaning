  "Q": "I got an ultra sound scan done of pelvic and abdomen . Everything looks normal except for the fibroid in uterus.this is what the report says uterus: anteverted and normal in size, shape contour with uniform echo texture. A mural fibroid measuring 1.6/ 1.4 cm is seen indenting the endometrium.subserous fibroid measuring 0.8/0.5 cm and 2.8/2.2 cm are also seen.endometrial thickness is 0.6 cm.  I want to know what the implications are? Will I be able to conceive? Can I deliver a baby?",
  "A": "Hi, Thanks for your query.  You are having fibroid mural and subserous type which are not harmful in pregnancy and not causing any infertility.  The submucous and intramural type fibroid are harmful for pregnancy and causing infertility, after mastectomy chances of pregnancy increased.  You are able to conceive and deliver a baby, so please go ahead.don't worry.  Your uterus normal and shape with uniform texture so no problem in conceiving and delivering a baby.  So don't worry. GOOD LUCK.and plan your pregnancy."
