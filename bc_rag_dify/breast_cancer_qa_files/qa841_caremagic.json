  "A": "Hi.how big is the fibroadenoma? Do you have a history of breast cancer in your family? Breast lesions, even if it is benign such as in your case, needs to be followed-up and regularly monitored. Annual physical examination and breast ultrasound is recommended in your age. If the lesion is enlarging, a follow-up consult with your doctor is best, for possible removal. Hope this helps. Good day!!~ Chat Doctor. "
