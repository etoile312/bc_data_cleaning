  "Q": "Im 21 years old and have had chicken pox. I feel like I have them again, I first thought that I was allergic to something but the bumps arent going away. They are on my stomach, legs and feet now and have been spreading/Ive been getting more over the past 2 days. I also have a fever...   I do not have insurance and was wondering if there was anything I could do at home to get healthy as fast as possible.",
