  "Q": "I have ehlers-danlos syndrome type 3 and 4 and I have asthma, IBS, IBD and various other problems that come with it. one of my major problems is my shoulders, I have large breasts and permanent indentations of where my bra straps sit. I dont feel any tissue where it rubs, just bone and I get horrible pains up my neck and along my arm. Its only on the left side (larger breast side) thankfully. Surgery is very risky for me because of the EDS...any other suggestions???",
