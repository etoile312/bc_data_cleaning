  "A": "Hi, Thanks for the query. You once consult gynecologist and go for blood test for pregnancy. If the test comes negative, you go for:Ultrasound, thyroid profile, prolactin levels. By this workup the possible cause for your problem can be identified. And depending on that treatment can be taken. After getting the periods track your ovulation and plan intercourse around that time. For more details you can ask me through: http://www.ChatDoctor .com/doctors/ Chat Doctor. "
