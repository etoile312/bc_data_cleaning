  "A": "Hi, Thanks for writing in. Chat Doctor.  Most causes of breast itching and flaking of skin are benign. Please consult your doctor for a clinical examination and diagnosis. It is important to confirm diagnosis. If required you can also get a screening mammography done to make sure there is no sign of malignancy in the breasts. Fungal infections are common in the breast region and can cause skin flaking with itchiness. There is sweat formation in the skin under the breast and this causes a favorable condition for the fungal infection. If confirmed it can be easily treated by applying antifungal ointment for a month."
