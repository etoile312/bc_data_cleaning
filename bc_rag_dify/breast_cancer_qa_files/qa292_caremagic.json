  "Q": "I am a 22 yr old patient, I had a miscarriage in June, and an abortion in September of this year (2011). I have found a small slightly painful lump on the right tail of the breast (near the arm pit). I also have a large lump on the top right breast, it takes up the whole top of the breast and ends near the areola, which does not radiate any pain. As far as I know, I do not have any family members with breast cancer. I do have Uterine cancer in the family, which THEN metastises to the breast. What could cause my lumps? I am uninsured and unemployed, so I cannot go to the Dr. office so easily. Any idea what it may be?",
  "A": "Thank you for asking Chat Doctor. My name is Chat Doctor. You have slightly painful lump on the right tail of the breast and a large lump on the top right breast. Along with that you have although no family history of breast diseases directly but a positive history of uterine cancer which then metastases to the breasts. I also understand your status of being uninsured and unemployed but remember that breast lumps are common. Most often they're noncancerous (benign), particularly in younger women. Still, no matter how old you are, It's important to have any breast lump evaluated by a doctor, especially if its new and feels different from surrounding breast tissue. Early evaluation is essential in such cases, so you should plan visiting your physician Hope this may help you. Let me know if anything is not clear. Thanks."
