  "Q": "What would cause pain in the armpits? Doesn t seem to be any swelling. I also often have pain high on the left side of my chest, not my heart, sometimes pain on the left side of my neck, again no swelling that I can tell. On days when the chest pain is worse I usually have a headache on the left side. Normal EKG in November, normal mammogram.",
  "A": "Hi, There are many causes for armpit pain. But if there is no swelling or no history of any injury along with pain at side of neck then it indicates towards a pulled pectoral muscle. You may have strained your pectorals while lifting something or doing any thing for extended period of time without stretched arm. So I will suggest you to apply hot pack and use any pain relieving gel or spray, and do minimal activity. Do take special care while traveling, it may get aggravated. And do thing with close to your body don't overstretch yourself. Follow for 2 weeks as your pain gets relieved do get back to us for a graded exercise regime that will make your muscles strong. Do eat proteins, calcium and vitamin C rich diet and these will help in early healing.  Hope you find the answer useful. Let me know if I can assist you further."
