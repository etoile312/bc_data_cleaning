  "Q": "Dear DoctorI did a ultrasound scanning yesterday & result on my liver was : \"A small echogenic lesion in left lobe of liver. Non-specific appearance and may represent a focal fatty liver, haemangioma or tumuor.\" I has breast cancer 8 years ago and my left breast was removed. My ultrasound scanning on the left chestwall and armpit are all fine. Does the above remark means I have metastatic cancer?",
  "A": "HelloWelcome to Chat Doctor From your report it is difficult to say whether that small lesion in your liver is cancer or not. Since you had breast cancer in the past, the chances of that being cancer is more than in other people. Only definitive way to make diagnosis is fine needle aspiration biopsy. If the lesion is big enough and accessible you can undergo this procedure. Another option is to do serial examination of lesion in routine interval and assess. Unfortunately except needle biopsy there are no other tests which can tell you whether that is cancer or not. Regards"
