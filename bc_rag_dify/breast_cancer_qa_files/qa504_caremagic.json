  "Q": "Hello, Female age 21 medical history sickle cell trait and anemic.I have a 2 year old daughter. My problem is i have been constipated lately,have a slight headache, my breasts have been very sore.My last period was may either the 18th or 21st.I know it should be coming again the end of this week.But i have not been experiencing any cramping and i begin to panic.Could i be pregnant again?",
  "A": "Hello, and I hope I can help you today. Any woman who has been having unprotected sex without using contraception is at risk for pregnancy. However, pregnancy symptoms vary widely between women, and many of the symptoms people associate with pregnancy like breast tenderness, cramping, bloating, and mood changes are also common with PMS.  So it really is not possible to predict pregnancy based solely on those type of symptoms. The most reliable sign of pregnancy is a missed menstrual period. So if you are at risk for pregnancy, see if your period arrives on time and if it does not, then perform a urine pregnancy test according to the package directions.  The urine pregnancy tests sold in stores are just as accurate as the ones in a doctor's office and are accurate even on the first day of a missed period.  I strongly advise against testing before you are late for your period as the results can be less reliable and conflicting. I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. Best wishes,"
