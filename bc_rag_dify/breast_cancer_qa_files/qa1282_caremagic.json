  "Q": "My 60yo wife has lumps in her breasts. 2 months ago, after seeing her family doctor, she had an intensive mammogram xray and the interpretation came back negative. Last week bruises suddenly appeared on her breasts, so she went to her doctor who barely examined her and said to come back 3 weeks later. Now, there are lumps underneath all the bruises. What kind of specialist should we see",
  "A": "Hi.it is best if you consult with a doctor, preferably a general surgeon or a general surgeon with specialization in breast surgery. Did your wife have a recent history of trauma or infection in her breasts? Combined studies of breast ultrasound and mammography may be requested as needed. Depending on the results on how management will ensue. If its just secondary to infection, medical management with antibiotics will be directed. If lesions are found, depending on the categorization, management will be monitoring and/or surgical. Hope this helps. Good day!!~ Chat Doctor. "
