  "Q": "I have just been diagnosed with level 2 breast cancer not in lymph nodes. Dr putting me on letrozole to shrink tumor. How can this shrink my tumor and help ladies get pregnant? I am 60 years old thank you is there any herbal meds that can do the same that dont have bad side effects?",
  "A": "Hi I did review your concern. Metronome is an estrogen production inhibitor. In this way it decreases estrogen in body and decreases tumor growth of those tumors which are tumor dependent like breast cancer. It also helps in pregnancy as it indirectly increases LH and FSH secretion and helps in ovulation in initial stages. I would advise you to do the same. Ayurvedic medications have no scientific basis however they can be tried if you have any person who has a successful experience with it. I hope this help swish you good luck."
