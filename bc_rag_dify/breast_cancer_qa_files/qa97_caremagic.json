  "Q": "My husband has a large, circular red ring under one of his armpits. The ring is approximately the size of an orange. We are using Cortisone cream at present. What could be the cause of this condition? Would you suggest I take him to a doctor immediately?",
  "A": "Hello and welcome to Chat Doctor I would keep a possibility of fungal infection. These is because of closely apposing body folds e.g. thighs and groin, maxilla, submammary folds etc. can trap sweat, heat and moisture, therefore making the area favorable for fungal proliferation. If I was the treating doctor I would have asked you to use a topical antifungal like clotrimazole cream, twice daily, regularly for 4 weeks. An Oral antifungal e.g. fluconazole once weekly for4 -6 weeks OR oral terminating once daily for 2-4 weeks, is also advisable for a more complete urban OTC antihistamine e.g. cetirizine 10Â mg once daily would help you in symptomatic itch relief. Keeping the folds Chat Doctor. Regards"
