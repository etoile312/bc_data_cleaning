  "Q": "I found a squishy lump on my right clavicle, my pa sent me for a ultra sound and she said that it is probably a fat pad. should I get a second opinion? my chest xray is normal as well as my mammogram. I was diagnosed with a mild case of sarcoid in my chest --not my lungs but it has since went away. I am very worried about the \"so called fat pad\" I used to smoke on and off, could this be throat cancer?",
  "A": "Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. You have lump in right clavicle area. Ultrasound report suggest fat pad. So it may be lipoma or some fat containing soft tissue tumor. Chances of throat cancer is very rare. So no need to worry about that. You should go for fine needle aspiration cytology or biopsy of that lump. It will give you exact diagnosis. Then you should take treatment accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have any doubts then contact me at bit.ly/ Chat Doctor. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health."
