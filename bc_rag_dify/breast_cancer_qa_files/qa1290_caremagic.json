  "Q": "I am 61 yrs. of age and I have just been contacted by my Northside Breast Cancer to have an ultrasound diagnostic after a suspicious finding on my 3d mammogram. Last year my 3d mammogram was normal. My maternal genetics are not positive. Mother - survivor of a 66 yr. old procedure (radical mastectomy from lobular carcinoma diagnosis) and a sibling post menopausal with a insuiti (sp carcinoma) type of breast cancer requiring a lumpectomy with radiation and chemotherapy. Two maternal aunts succumbed to breast cancer (post menopausal ages) and a maternal aunt survivor with double mastectomy. Afraid, yes. I have my ultrasound tomorrow a.m. (Not a smoker, took birth control for 3-4 years in younger years..Drink alcohol responsibly,) Appreciate feedback.",
  "A": "When a suspicious area is seen on mammogram, it needs to be examined either by fine needle aspiration or biopsy. These tests would give definite answer of cancer. Just by having strong family history you need not have cancer. Since the risk is more, you need regular screening and anything abnormal can be taken care of. Once advise is that need to stop taking alcohol since alcohol enhances cancer risk. Instead of worrying over family history, best would be to get rid of risky habits."
