  "Q": "Hi, I started taking Birth control for my first time and while I was on it I randomly stopped taking it before I finished the Pack. While I was off the pill I had sex with my partner a few times without any type of protection. After 3 days later I had my period. Can I possibly be pregnant even though I had my period. I waited for my period to end until I started my new pack of Birth Control. I have experienced Breast Tenderness and I have had morning sickness a few times. I am almost done with my pack of Birth control pills for this month. Can I be pregnant?",
  "A": "Hi, Thanks for the query. I understand your concern.  Actually oral contraceptives need to be taken very regularly. As prescribed. At a fixed time of day.  You had missed few pills in first cycle. Had with Chat Doctor.  You started new pack have finished that too.... with morning sickness sore breast !  It has created complete confusion. Break in taking pills . Creates possibility of conception. Though signs of breast tenderness & nausea suggest. Pregnancy needs to be confirmed by urine pregnancy test after 8 days delay in menses.  In case test is +ve please get MTP done with gynecologists advise.  Thanks."
