  "Q": "Routine mammogram done last week came back with focal asymmetry in left breast. Spot compression is recommended. Going tomorrow for spot compressions. I have had 3 biopsies (all benign) and fibroadenoma removal (benign) on this breast. One of the biopsies was last year (same breast, left) for microcalcifications (benign). Had to go back for spot compression last year also, same breast, same finding. Should I be concerned?",
  "A": "Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. You may have benign proliferative breast lesion like fibroadenoma or other. However you should go for either fine needle aspiration cytology or biopsy to rule out cancer. Consult your doctor and plan accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have any doubts then contact me at bit.ly/ Chat Doctor. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health."
