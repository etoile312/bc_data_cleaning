  "Q": "I have a hard lump 4 in below my collarbone and above my right breast. I noticed it in January. My gynecologist said it was nothing and I was to young to have a mammogram. Well its August now and the pain has grown since. My primary Dr scheduled a mammogram . I went today and the technician says it too high to be the breast area for a mammogram . She did it anyways but suggested an ultrasound. I did make a follow up appointment. I wondering what it is. Its slightly visible. Hard sometimes its seems larger on days. But the pain wakes me up at night now. Help",
  "A": "Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. Your lump area is too high for breast pathology.  It may be some soft tissue mass like lipoma, neurofibroma or other. Demography is not needed.  You should go for fine needle aspiration cytology or biopsy.  It will help you to search the cause. Then you should take treatment accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health."
