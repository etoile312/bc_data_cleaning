  "Q": "My seven year old daughter told me this morning she has a tender spot on her chest. it is between the arm pit and her right nipple. It is not close to the nipple at all, it is closer to her arm pit. She moved away when I palpated the area. I found a pea size knot. She says it only hurts when touched. I understand girls at this age get prepuberty nodules, but most that I have read of are around or under the nipple. this is not close to the nipple. it is almost in her arm pit.",
  "A": "Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. She has enlarged axillary lymph node or breast lump. If it is lymph node then it is most likely to be due to reactive hyperplasia.  Rarely it can be due to tuberculosis, lymphoma or other cause.  She should take a course of antibiotics. If it doesn't respond to treatment then biopsy diagnosis is advisable. If it is breast lump then it can be due to fibroadenoma. Consult your doctor and take treatment accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health."
