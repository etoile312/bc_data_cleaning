Honestly, I don t want to treatment like that pain to make me to live longer.. What is best ? the pain with long life with chemo, or try to live every moment best..",
  "A": "Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. You have breast cancer. It is stage 4 cancer. Surgery is not useful in this stage. So treatment options are chemotherapy and radiotherapy. But it will not cure the disease. It just works as palliative therapy. Despite all treatment prognosis remains poor. Life expectancy is not good. Sorry to say but it is fact. For pain relief morphine can be used. It is indicated in terminal stage cancer pain. Consult your oncologist and plan accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have any doubts then contact me at bit.ly/ Chat Doctor. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health."
