  "Q": "Im 28 years old, female, healthy - in my left breast I have had discharge for the last few years. You have to apply some pressure, but when you do white stuff definitely comes out. Also, in right breast I have a mass of something at the bottom of my breast (not directly under the skin, you have to apply a little pressure to feel it, and its def NOT there in the left breast). Are these two things related and should make a special apt to have them examined or should I just wait until my next annual?  Everything I read says breast cancer feels like a hard pea in the breast, mine feels more like a semi-hard marble, but not perfectly round. I really never go to the Dr. so Im inclined to just wait, but now of course Im freaking myself out. Any advise would help!",
  "A": "Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. You may have some benign proliferative breast lesion like fibroadenoma or fibrotic disease.  However, possibility of cancer can not rule out.  You should not wait till your next annual check up. You should go for fine needle aspiration cytology and demography.  It will give you exact diagnosis. Then you should take treatment accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health."
