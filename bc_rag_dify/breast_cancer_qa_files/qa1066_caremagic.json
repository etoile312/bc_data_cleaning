  "Q": "Hi im trying to get pregnant but I ve always had an irregular cycle but now i have pregnancy symptoms. Nausea, tender breast, craving, lower back pain, and stomach aches but the pregnancy test keep coming up negative. Do i need to go get a blood pregnancy did? r is this normal? HELP! Thanks",
  "A": "Early pregnancy symptoms are nausea, vomiting, dizziness, somnolence, breast tenderness but are not specific and depend on personal social and cultural issues. Hypersensitive nipples is a far more sensitive symptom of pregnancy than the other ones and seldom described. Anyway, if there is a missed period along with suspicious symptoms you should perform a pregnancy test to confirm or rule out pregnancy. Abdominal pain is not a symptom of pregnancy, but it is frequently reported during early pregnancy, and it is related to the ovary that ovulated and is harboring the progesterone producing Corpus Luteum that is nourishing the developing products of conception. Good Luck!"
