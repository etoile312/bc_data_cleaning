  "A": "Degree understand your concerns went through your details. I suggest you not to worry much. Such hallucinations do occur in everybody's life. They are just hallucinations and nothing real at all. You can ask anyone. This happens when we are worried, when our eyes are watery, when we are in deep thinking, anxious, suddenly move head and come back to previous position etc. There is nothing to understand about it. Just forget the incident and that is it. For such hallucinations you need not be a psychotic of neurotic. Hope this answers your query. Available for further clarifications. Good luck."
