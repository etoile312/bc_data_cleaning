  "A": "Hi, there is increased chance of uterine rupture After mastectomy if you become pregnant soon. So, to heal the scar, 6 months to one year gap is recommended.  But as you have got pregnant, be a little aware that after 8 months starting, you should be cautious of any pain in abdomen.  Visit a doctor immediately if pain is there. Baby will require delivery by cesarean in most of the cases. Hope I have answered your question. Regards Chat Doctor. "
