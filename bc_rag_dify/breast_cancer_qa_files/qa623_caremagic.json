  "A": "As you have a family history of breast cancer, you need to be on screening mammogram/MRI depending on the amount of risk. The round patch on your back with severe itching needs dermatologist consultation to rule out common diseases before considering as a sign of malignancy. You also need to have genetic counselling for the family history of breast cancer which will reduce your concern of death. You may also need to undergo bilateral mastectomy to prevent the risk of breast cancer and vasectomy if completed family."
