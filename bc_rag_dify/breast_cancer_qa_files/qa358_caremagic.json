  "Q": "I am presently receiving chemo for breast cancer.  Most of my hair is gone but still have a little Fuzz on my head which is driving me crazy.  It sticks to my pillow etc.  I want it ALL off but do not have an electric razor and am concerned abut using a regular razor for fear of nicking my scalp and causing an infection.  Can I use a product like \"NAIR\" on my head to get the rest of my hair off??I know this seems like a silly question but it would increase my comfort level.  I am 41 yrs old   Thanks",
  "A": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern Yes you can use this method of hair removal. No harm in it. But better to do it safely and with all antiseptic precautions. Because cancer patients, who are on chemotherapy are at higher risk of skin infection due to immunosuppression by chemotherapy. So use proper aseptic solution before applying NAIR. Also wash your scalp with antiseptic solution after removal of hair. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks."
