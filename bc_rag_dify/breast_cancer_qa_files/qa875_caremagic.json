My family doctor is away. Have a follow up appt. in 4 weeks for more pictures and a ultrasound. I am 58 years old and very active. There is a history of cancer in my family. I am very nervous. Should I push to have the test sooner as this is the first opening. Is there a chance it is cancer.",
  "A": "Hi, I appreciate your concern and glad that you reach out to experts with your concerns and not just google your concerns. Now, coming to your question, any abnormality in breast in a lady above 50 years should be evaluated for breast cancer, since it is the most common cancer in the world as per current data. However, fortunately breast cancer is one of the slow growing cancers, 4 weeks won't make much of a difference. But I emphasize do not delay the tests further and continue timely treatment as and when advised. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. "
