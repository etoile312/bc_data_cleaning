  "A": "HIT hank for asking to ChatDoctorI appreciate your concern here are the answers of your questions 1) while comparing with the normal breast, the normal breast looks more pendulous than the malignant one, on palpation one can feel the hard lump inside the breast, untreated case more prone to fungal infection, loss of weight.2) If you find the lump look for mobility if this is freely moves then no need to worry, still mammogram, CT scan, biopsy are must.3) Wearing the bra does not cause the cancer. 4) NO if this benign lesion then this can not turn into malignancy. 5) The breast malignancy is not always inherit ant. 5) Being a female you could get the breast cancer this is not true, but of course the incidence increased. 6) If you are physically active then the chances of these reduces greatly. 7) The balance and healthy diet makes the difference. 8) the chances of breast cancer in smokers is higher than the non-smokers, and the same is true for alcohol, hope this information helps you have nice day."
