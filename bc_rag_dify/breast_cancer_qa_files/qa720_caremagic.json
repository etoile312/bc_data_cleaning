  "Q": "So me qnd my husband are trying to conceive. I had sex twoevery two days starting two days before ovulating. At those times I expierienced light cramping, some diarrhea,  and bloating. Now five days before my period I woke to light spotting, only when using bathroom and now have cramps. Ive read about implantation bleeding and am hoping this is what is occurring. The spotting has stopped and now I just have normal discharge. Did we vet pregnant or am I just getting hopes up? I had a miscarriage last year but prior too I had other pregnancy symptoms like breast tenderness. I am not feeling that now but its onoy nine dqys after ovulation. Please help me understand and what to look for in next couple of days! And if this is implantation occurring is there anythiny i can do to make the pregnancy more vialble? My email is  YYYY@YYYY  I am 23 and not on birth control.",
  "A": "Hi and thanks for this query. Trying to get pregnant often creates anxiety. I understand your feelings and concerns. This could be implantation bleed as well as it could be something totally unrelated to pregnancy. My advice now is that you stay patient and wait for the due date of your menses. If they do not come, then do a rapid urine pregnancy test and get the answer to this. If your menses should come, please don't get discouraged. Getting pregnant is a continuous trial and takes luck. If it didn't happen this time around, it may as well happen the next time you try to. Keep trying till you get pregnant. Hope this helps. Wish you success as you try to get pregnant."
