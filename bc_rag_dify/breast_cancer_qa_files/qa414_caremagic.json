  "Q": "I have PCOS so very irregular periods and I usually suffer from extreme breast tenderness at least a week before my period (sometimes 2) and then quite a painful and heavy period which lasts 6 days.  I had no symptoms then got a period on 25th April. (My last one was 1st March) It was very strange as I had no major cramps, just little jitters and a little back ache. It was also very light for 5 days then was heavy for a day with a big clot and then light for 2 more days. Yesterday 10th May I wiped and had some pinkish/reddish discharge and again this morning. I have had a lot of heart burn and Ive been exhausted more than usual. I did do a Hpt, but got a negative. Could I be pregnant? Have an infection? Or are my hormones just up the left?",
