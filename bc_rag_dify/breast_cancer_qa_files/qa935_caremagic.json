Its so weird because when i get my period my cramps are horrible and my vagina gets this stabing pain. (im a virgin so i know its no std ) please help. ovarian cancer runs in my family so im pretty scared.",
  "A": "Hello! Thank you for the query. Lower left abdominal pain can be caused by diverticulitis, urinary tract infection, ovarian cyst. Ovarian cancer can also give such symptom as well as ovarian cyst. Stomach pain seems to be caused by stomach disease like peptic ulcers or acid reflux disease. Sharp pain in the chest can appear due to rib nerves irritation. But most likely your stomach pain and sharp chest pain is caused by stress (as you have admitted being scared about cancer, this can trigger such symptoms). If an ovarian cancer runs in your family (and maybe breast cancer?) you should consult oncologist as some of such hereditary cancers are caused by genes mutations. You should have checked BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations. Ca-125 level and transvaginal ultrasound should be also performed. Lower abdominal pain should be consulted with gastroenterologist and some blood tests and urine tests should be performed. Hope this will help. Regards."
