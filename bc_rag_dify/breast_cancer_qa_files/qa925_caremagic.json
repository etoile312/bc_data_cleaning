  "Q": "i am 35 year old and i have been diagnosed with Fibrolipoma/lipoma on my left breast. prominent duct seen in retroareolar quadrant of left breast. Now i would like to know how dangerous is this and is there any chance of cancer occurence in future as my mother caught with breast cancer diseases.",
  "A": "Hello Breast lipoma rarely undergo malignant transformation and these lesions are not associated with increased risk of developing breast cancer. Lipomas are mostly asymptomatic and coincidentally noticed on routine mammography however some patients may present with a painless palpable breast lump. Mostly it doesn't require any treatment, but enlargement of lipoma is an indication for biopsy. Get well soon. Take care Chat Doctor. "
