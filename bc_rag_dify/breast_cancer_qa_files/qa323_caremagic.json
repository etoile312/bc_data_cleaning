  "Q": "Hello. I have a lump in my left armpit. It doesnt hurt. I was told, by a dr who didnt really look, that it was probably just a swollen lymph node because at the time I had a double ear infection and it would go away; however, that infection was almost a year ago, the lump has actually gotten slightly bigger. I do have a family history of breast cancer. I wanted to know if this is something I should be concerned about. I know its not the most common place to find breast cancer, but it still is a little unsettling.",
  "A": "Hello rearward welcome to Chat Doctor.come have evaluated your query thoroughly.* The long-standing maxilla lymph node must be evaluated for the cause as - chronic inflammation - tuberculosis - secondary involvement from malignancy at other site - others.* Must get excision biopsy of the same to cure and diagnose pathology. Hope this clears your doubt . Wishing you fine recovery. Welcome for any further assistance. Regards take care."
