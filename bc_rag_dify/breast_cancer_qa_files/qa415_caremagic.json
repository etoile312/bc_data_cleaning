  "Q": "I was diagnosed in Jan of this year with stage ll ductal cancer. I had a lumpectomy Feb 13. No lymph node involvement and clear margins. I had the ONCO DX test and my score was 17. I chose not to have chemo but agreed to radiation which is , I guess, protocol. It has been close to three months now and I still have not been cleared for radiation. What are my chances of survival if I do not have radiation? I am also taking Aridimex. ER PR positive Her2 neg.",
  "A": "There are a few problems in the way you are being treated. First, Ecotype DX is not for stage II breast cancer, only for stage I node negative cancer. Stage 2 patient should always get chemotherapy. Secondly, in patients who conserve the breast, radiotherapy is mandatory without which, the disease is bound to come back in the same breast. Thirdly, the radiation should be started as soon as possible after surgery and definitely within 2 months. So please start radiation asap else your disease will definitely recur. Lastly, Armies is started after radiation therapy and not before or along with."
