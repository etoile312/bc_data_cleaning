I m on birthcontrol pills have been since I was 22 when I got married I m now 43 yrs old should I go to doctor?",
  "A": "Hi! Good evening. I am Chat Doctor answering your query. If I were your doctor, after a general and local physical examination of both side breasts, I would advise you for a FNAC (fine needle aspiration cytology) of the newly developed lump. Further management would depend on the cytological report of the FNAC. I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem. Please do not hesitate to ask in case of any further doubts. Thanks for choosing Chat Doctor to clear doubts on your health problems. I wish you an early recovery. Chat Doctor."
