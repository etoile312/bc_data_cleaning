  "Q": "i have a realtive that was recently diagnosed with lobular carcinoma I was curious as what the life expectancy is for this type of cancer. She recenlty had a dsouble mastectomy as well at lymphectomy of three lymph nodes and test showed that it was in her lymph nodes I am not sure as to what stage she is in I am trying to get a feel as to time line what is typical",
  "A": "Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. She has lobular type pf breast cancer.  If it is treated in early stage then life expectancy is very good.  5 year survival rate is high.  So life expectancy depends on stage and spread of cancer.  Moreover, chemotherapy and hormone receptor status also affect the prognosis.  But overall life expectancy is good. So don't worry about that. Just be relaxed. Continue with your treatment. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health."
