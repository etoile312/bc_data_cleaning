  "Q": "I had chemo 2 years ago Cytoxin/Taxotere for breast cancer and am currently on Tamoxifen, Toprol 100mg,TriamtereneHCTZ 37.25mg. I was taking Lortab 7.25-500mg but that was currently changed to Lortab 7.5-325mg. Last night was the first time taking the new pills, and I keep get this fluttering like heart thing that makes me want to breath really deep or cough then I m fine. Now you should know I extremely sensitive to meds as changing from one brand of tamoxifen to another is truly a beast!",
  "A": "Hello There After going through your medical query I understand your concern and I would like to tell you that palpitation can be a common side effect of chemotherapy but breathing difficulty can be due to cardiac arrhythmia, so it is recommended for you to get an ECG and an echocardiography done and consult your treating physician for medical treatment. Hopefully this information will guide you properly. Kind Regards Chat Doctor. "
