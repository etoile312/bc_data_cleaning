  "Q": "My husband, age 65, has diabetes and on the cusp of 4th stage renal disease. He had to get up to urinate more last night than usual. No pain. Woke up, had fever 99.4-100.4 and blood sugar was 179. I sponged him down and gave him lots of fluids and brought his fever down. Now at 6:30 he has chills and fever again. Any ideas? He doesn t seem to have any respiratory problems, outside of the chronic COPD.",
  "A": "Hi, Thanks for your question. I feel really sorry after going through your question. Most likely possibility in your husband is urinary infections. You should consult your doctor immediately. There is need for - 1) Detailed clinical Examination. 2) Urine Examination along with urine culture. 3) Blood tests like Complete mammogram, Renal Function Test, Liver Function Test, Serum Calcium, Magnesium, Phosphates. 4) Ultrasonography of abdomen and Pelvis. 5) Cardiac evaluation. 6) Blood sugar monitoring. 7) May require Insulin for better Diabetes control. He may require Intravenous Antibiotics with close monitoring of renal functions. Monitoring of respiratory function is also important as his COPD may complicate his recovery. Hope this helps you, if so do vote."
