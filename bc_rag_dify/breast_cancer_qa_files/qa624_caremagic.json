  "Q": "I have a strong family history of breast cancer (mother at 47 and aunt at 49). I am 22 years old, and had a biopsy on a spot in my left breast that they removed completely in 2009. They stated it was a fibroadenoma at the time. In August 2010 I had an ultrasound, and they said that they could no longer see the fibroadenoma. Last week I had another ultrasound and the spot is about the same size as it was when it was originally biopsied. They stated it could be a phyllodes tumor, but want me to wait 6 months to have another ultrasound. From what I have read about phyllodes tumors, if this is one, I dont want to wait that long. Should I see a breast surgeon?",
  "A": "Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. You may have fibroadenoma or Phyllis tumor or some other lesion.  Ultrasound doesn't give perfect idea.  You should go for biopsy of that lump. It will give you exact diagnosis. Then you should take treatment accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health."
