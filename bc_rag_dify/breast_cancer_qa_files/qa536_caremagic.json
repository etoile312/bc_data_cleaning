  "Q": "I have found a module in front of my ear opening, but above my jaw line. I have menieres but the last year the symptoms have increased in intensity and occurrence. I also had breast cancer with chemo, radiation, ending in surgery Dec of 13. The menieres made it difficult to recover my strength. Could what I found contribute to imbalance, light headed, mental fog and confusion?",
  "A": "Hi Dear, Welcome to Chat Doctor. Understanding your concern.  As per your query you have symptoms of ear lump above jaw line. The symptoms you mention in query are pointing towards a condition known as Lymphadenopathy. It is swelling of your lymph nodes which are part of your immune system. It is usually caused by a bacterial or viral infection. Need not worry. I would suggest you to consult ENT specialist for proper examination without any delay, because sometimes infection can spread to surroundings. Doctor may order blood test, X-ray or CT scan to confirm the diagnosis and to rule to condition like cyst. Doctor may prescribe antibiotics course at least for a week. Till then give warm compresses to swelling. Hope your concern has been resolved. Get Well Soon. Best Wishes,"
