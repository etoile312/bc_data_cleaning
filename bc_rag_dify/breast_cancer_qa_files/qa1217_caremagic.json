  "Q": "My daughter is 8 years old and I was putting sunblock all over her yesterday and I noticed that she has a lump under each of her nipples smaller than a marble but bigger than a pea.  I was just curious if this is normal?  And does it mean that she is going to start developing?  Or should I be concerned?",
  "A": "Hi, Dear , Good Evening. Thanks for your query to Chat Doctor. This is Chat Doctor.  I studied your query in-depth and understood your health concerns. In My opinion the daughter -is developing and is entering pubertal changes in her breasts.That's why she has lumps under each of the breast nipples. You should not worry about it to be Cancerous -as these are normal puberty changes in her breasts. So you should not worry and feel concerned for these breast lumps. If it still worries You as parent-consult ER primary doctor who would examine and re-assure about the above NORMAL BREASTS.-Hope this would help you to plan treatment with your ER doctor.-Welcome for further queries for this issue to Chat Doctor. Wishing a fast recovery for you. Have a Good day. Regards"
