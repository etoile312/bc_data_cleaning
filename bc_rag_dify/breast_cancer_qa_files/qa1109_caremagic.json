  "Q": "hi i have just been diagnosed with breast cancer, operation showed clean margin an nothing in the lymph node, i have found a dark round pea sized lump on my forearm that is darker than the surrounding skin. could it be the cancer has spread. it has been 4 weeks after operation starting kemo next tuesday.",
  "A": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. Clinical examination of your forearm swelling is must. And I don't thick it is due to malignant spread as your lymph nodes are clear for malignancy. Breast cancers travel mostly through lymphatic system.  So once lymph nodes are clear for malignancy chances of spread in skin is less likely. So I suggest you to first get done clinical examination of forearm swelling. It may be due to allergy or insect bite etc. If suspicious biopsy is needed."
