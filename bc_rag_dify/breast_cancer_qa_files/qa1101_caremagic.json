  "Q": "I have a baseball size mass on my right chest area just below the collarbone. Ultrasound said it has little blood flow, but is a solid mass. It is not painfull.  I had a mastectomy 3 years ago. I am 156lbs 5 ft tall.  I see an oncologist on Tuesday, they say not to worry, but an oncologist scares me. What could my mass be?",
  "A": "Hi, Dear,Thanks for the query to my Chat Doctor clinic. I studied your query in depth. In my opinion-dear, you appear to have-a recurrence of breast tumor in-infra-clavicular? Nodes or remaining breast tissue. I would advise a-FNAC Biopsy and Surgical excision after US-FNAC or CT/PET guided FNAC would resolve your worry. In good faith and reason-Your oncologist may not be disclosing all this, but with open request to a Surgeon, this is the line of treatment for your problem. Hope you have cleared your worry. Would welcome you to Chat Doctor for any more queries on it or on other health-problem."
