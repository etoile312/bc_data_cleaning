  "A": "Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. She has history of breast cancer, and it was treated by surgery and chemotherapy. Her weakness may be due to anemia or hypoglycemia or thyroid disease or some other problem. She should go for complete blood count, blood sugar test, thyroid function test first. These will help you find the cause of weakness. Then she should take treatment according to cause. Hope I have answered your question, if you have any doubts then contact me at bit.ly/ Chat Doctor. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health."
