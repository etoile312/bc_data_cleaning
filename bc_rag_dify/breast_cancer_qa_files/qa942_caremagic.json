  "Q": "I recently noticed a lump under my arm pit 2 days ago that at first was sensitive to the touch. There is no history of breast cancer in my family that i know of , but im worried because my mom just died of cancer. I have never had a mammogram and im 40 years old. Is there something i can do to examine that would possibly help ease my mind so i dont think its anything fatal?  The lump dosent move when i roll my fingertips across it and its a little smaller than a dime! What should i do?",
  "A": "Hi, Thanks for your question. I can understand your concern. You should not be so anxious. There may be enlarged axillary lymph nodes due to some infection or there may cellulitis. You should consult your doctor for detailed clinical Examination of lump, breast tissues, lungs. Depending upon Examination there may be need for chest X-ray, mammograms, complete blood count, blood sugar levels. In case of infection use of antibiotics may help. Hope this helps you, if so do vote."
