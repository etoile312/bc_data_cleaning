  "Q": "Hi Doc. Im 35, and 1.5 months pregnant with my first. My new OBGYN is recommending I take Endogest 200 x 2 per day - but I have a history of breast cancer in my family (my mother, not me). Should I take it? And second, is the oral dosage different than the vaginal dosage?",
  "A": "Hi, Yes, it is safe to take during pregnancy. Eldest is a synthetic form of female hormone progesterone. It supports and maintains a normal pregnancy and also prevents miscarriage and preterm labor. Since you have a family history of breast cancer, it should be taken at the lowest effective doses and for the shortest duration. Yes, vaginal dose is about 100 mg 2 to 3 times a day. Hope I have answered your question. Let me know if I can assist you further. "
