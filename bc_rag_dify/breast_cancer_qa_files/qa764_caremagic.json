  "Q": "I have a knot on one of my lower right ribs, not near the spine. I am also a breast cancer survivor, lumpectomy, right side, 5 years since diagnosis. My docs seem to think there is nothing to be concerned about, but no imaging tests have been ordered. One doc suggested that it is a calcium deposit. Is this probable?",
  "A": "Hello, It could be anything ranging from a soft tissue swelling or mass to a bony swelling. If its consistency is soft and bulbous it could be a lipoma and if its hard as stone it would be a bony deposit, anything in between could be anything. You hadn't mentioned the duration and associated symptoms. In case it is of long duration and causing any discomfort, you need to get an x-ray chest app view and a FNAC of swelling to reach out for the diagnosis. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Take care "
