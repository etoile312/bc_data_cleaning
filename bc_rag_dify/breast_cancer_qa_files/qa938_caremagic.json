  "Q": "Went to get an ultrasound last week for abdominal pain. 3 cm cyst on left ovary and smaller cyst on right ovary. Having a lot of fluttering in my left lower abdomen that can be described that feels like a baby moving. Have pain still in left pelvic area. Always bloated, always feeling full, losing hair and peeing often. I have had two children, I am 28, I have had breast cancer. Negative pregnancy tests. I am 5 5 and 170 pounds. What could the fluttering feeling mean? I am positive it is not just gas.",
  "A": "Hi. Thanks for your query and an elucidated history. Yes, there has to be a reason for this fluttering feeling and pain in left pelvic area and the feeling of baby moving. Your history of cancer breast noted, very uncommon at such a younger age. I would suggest you the following since you have a complicated history for your young age. Go for CT scan of the Abdomen to make certain that the cancer has not spread to the ovaries, the cysts of the ovaries can in fact be secondary cancer growth. This will prove what it is. This can be colitis as you are loosing hair, bloated and feeling full. I would advise in such a case the following:Take a course of an antibiotic and metronidazole, activated charcoal tablets, probiotics and most important the therapeutic dosages of Multivitamins. This may help you symptomatically."
