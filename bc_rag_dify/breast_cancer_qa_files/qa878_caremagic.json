  "Q": "I have lump, the size of a roma tomato, underneath my left breast. I showed it to my doctor last year in my yearly physical. She said it was probably a fatty tumor. Well this thing has grown and is feeling harder than last year. How big do these fatty tumors get and are they usually hard????Since I am being prompted to add my age, weight and such...here it goes. I am 44,five nine and 240 lbs. My medical history consists of high blood pressure since I was 24 and two c-sections. And this lump is under the breast, in the upper rib cage area, not in the breast. And yes I have had a mammogram, it showed nothing.",
  "A": "Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. You have soft tissue mass. Your mammography is normal so no need to worry about breast cancer. It can be lipoma, neurofibroma, dermatofibroma or some other mass. You should go for fine needle aspiration cytology or biopsy of that lump. It will give you exact idea regarding diagnosis. Then you should take treatment accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have any doubts then contact me at bit.ly/ Chat Doctor. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health."
