  "Q": "I felt a lump on my breast and had a mammogram on Friday followed by an ultrasound. The doctor who read the results is not concerned with waht I felt, but is concerned with what he saw under my right arm. He said it needs to be surgically removed and I will be seeing an oncology surgeon. I have been consumed by this. What should I expect? Thank u for your time.",
  "A": "Hi, Dear,Thanks for your query to Chat Doctor virtual Clinic. I studied your query in all the details put forth by you. I understood your health concerns. Cause of the health problems you queried-With very limited information on the breast lump, its very difficult to comment on the surgical intervention advised for right under arm lump associated with your right breast lump. As you had got Mammography of the Right breast done from your doctor, which was followed by USG study of the breast and the under arm area, your doctor may be right in advising you on the first information he got after this radiological investigation, about which I have very limited information from your query. Your doctor may be worried about the under arm lump and advised its surgical removal, this indicates that in the context of your mammogram and the USG studies, he suspects some growth /?tumor which could be of malignant type and needs EXCISION BIOPSY OF that right underarm lump, after which he could plan for the definitive treatment of the breast lump you felt. Still if you are worried I would suggest you to Consult ER Surgeon on this, who would give his Second opinion after doing needful Breast Lump FNAC Biopsy and or/FNAC Biopsy of the Underarm Lump, which is done With PET CAT scan guiding, would increase the chances of detecting any suspected malignant tumor and would fix the best treatment for your breast lump. Remedy-I would advise you to consult ER Surgeon urgently because you had worries from the reports and advise of your doctor, about which I have very limited information to comment on. So till the time you consult ER Surgeon and get his definitive opinion after above investigations, DONT WORRY AT ALL. And act fast on the above suggestions, which helps you to plan treatment with your ER Surgeon. Hope this would resolve your query with full satisfaction.
