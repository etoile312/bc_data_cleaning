  "Q": "I had 2 lymph nodes removed 1 1/2 years ago everything all clear. I had meonoma on a mole in the middle of my chest. Surgeon went through all channels and all clear. Ever since the nodes have been removed I have had a lump in that place. I had a mammogram and they wanted me to have ultra sound to see what the lump was. Is it common to get scarring from the surgery",
  "A": "Hi, DEar, thanks for your query to Chat Doctor. I studied your query in depth.1-In My opinion the lump in the scar/ or the hardened-hematoma -is very rare occurrence -and is a case of -KELOID-excess fibrous deposits in the scar- and is a personal variation. I mean this in the background of Surgeons clear certification -after lymph node removal for the melanoma in the mole-in the middle of the chest. 2-I would advise you to -have -Inj-kenacort- if the lump-is confirmed as Keloid by biopsy ONLY.3- FNAC biopsy is a must before any treatment for the lump in scar post-surgery.3-a-I would advise -to consult Surgeon who would treat you on the lines suggested above.USG-may help to fix the reason to some extent -as your mammogram is done4-Hope this would solve your query.5-Wellcome for any more questions on new or this subject also... Hava A Good Day.!!"
