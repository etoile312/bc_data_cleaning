  "Q": "Hi, so recently on the left side of my body just below my breast, it feels like I have a fatty lump on my last rib. When I lift up my shirt, the left side is clearly bigger than the right side is. And it feels sore when i push on it in a certain spot. also when i sit it just feels uncomfortable sometimes. when i rub it, it feels a little numb. What could it be? I dont have health insurance so Im trying to avoid that if I can.",
  "A": "Hello! Thank you for the query. It is very important to determine if this lump comes from the breast or is a separate thing. In case of breast lump it can be even a cancer that is why it should not be ignored. If you are sure this is separate thing, most likely it is a lipoma or other benign lesion. The best way to find out what it is, is to have soft tissues' ultrasound of this area. Hope this will help. Regards."
