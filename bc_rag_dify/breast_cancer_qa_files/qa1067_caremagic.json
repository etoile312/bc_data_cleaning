  "Q": "I have very bad body aches and joint pain. I had a mastectomy on 02/04/14 for stage 1 HER positive right breast cancer. PET scan in April 2014 was negative. I took anastrozole 1 mg for about two and a half weeks but the side effects were too much to take it so I told my doctor and quit taking it. My symptoms were dizziness, hot flashes, body aches/joint pain, insomnia and hair thinning. I am still having all these symptoms even thought it has been about 3 weeks since stopping the medication.",
  "A": "Hi, thank you for providing the brief history of you. A thorough musculoskeletal assessment is advised. As you have pain, aches, dizziness etc. I will advise you to perform regular exercises as this will help the body to improve the metabolism, immune system, blood carrying oxygen capacity, etc. Post breast cancer the body is pretty week and needs a self effort to fight improve the ADL. In my clinical practice I see cases with similar complains post mastectomy and with physical therapy they respond well to their overall health condition.regards Jay In Chat Doctor. "
