  "Q": "I m a 39 year old cancer survivor of breast cancer in the last 6 months I have had several upper and lower stomach issues ulcers bleeding and 45 lbs of weight loss and an escalating tacacardia 100to 150 bpm I have seen 5 different doctors all who send me to another then another did see my oncologist about a week ago after labs were done he ordered a ct scan still waiting for results does it always take so long",
  "A": "It would have helped to know the initial stage of your cancer and the time that has elapsed since you finished treatment. That would have helped me assess the risk of recurrence of your cancer. That is my only concern at the moment. Your weight loss is the concerning feature for recurrence. What recurrence doesn't explain is your raised heart beat. As an oncologist I would have ordered a PET scan rather than a CT scan as that would have scanned your entire body. Anyway, now that you have gotten a CT scan done it is prudent to wait for the results. Normally, the results take a day to a week depending upon the center."
