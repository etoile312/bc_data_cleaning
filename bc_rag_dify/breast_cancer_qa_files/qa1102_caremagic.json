  "Q": "I m a 22 year old female. I have a dull pain that comes and goes on my right side from my arm pit to the bottom of my rib cage. I also have a small round lump on my right breast. Just wondering if this could be of any concern. No medical history of anything serious.",
  "A": "Hello, What I understand by the history that you need to get firstly the lump in the breast examined by the gynecologist. As sometimes there is a physical examination more helpful along with the present verbal history. The mammary glands located in the breast do get lumps and needs an examination of its location. Once having it checked the next treatment plan can be taken up. At times even with the lump, there is not much indicative pathology but ruling out any possible cause will be of great help for peace of mind. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.  Jay In Chat Doctor. "
