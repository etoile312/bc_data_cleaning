  "Q": "Hi, I am 26 years old, a few months ago I found a lump in my breast, I went to the doctor, got a sonogram because my breasts are really dense, and I was diagnosed with fibrocystic breast disease. I have 3 cysts, 1 fibroaendonoma, and 2 suggestive fibroaendonomas. I was looking in the mirror, and I noticed an indent in my breast where one of the lumps are. It is also slightly painful---more uncomfortable. How likely is it that I have breast cancer?",
  "A": "Hello there... Breast cancer is not very common at the age of 26. The lump you are feeling would also be a part of your fibrotic disease... The kind of lump usually changes there size during menstruation and with age.... They are usually benign in nature and there are very minimal chance of cancer within it... If at all this lumps causing discomfort to you.surgical excision can be done as last resort."
