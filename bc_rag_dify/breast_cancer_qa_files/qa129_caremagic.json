  "Q": "I am having a biopsy Tuesday for Microcalcifications , deemed suspicious , they are in one cluster and a couple more less than a centimeter away . How likely is that to be cancer and if so can they treat it by doing a lumpectomy instead of Mastectomy?",
  "A": "Dear mam. Since the biopsy is suspicious. I hope mammogram is done. We need to look into the size of the lesion. If its just focal, it can be removed by lumpectomy with wide local excision, and we need to ask the pathologist to look into margins of the specimen. If margins are clear, nothing to worry. If affordable, better that you get a FDG PET scan done and look if it's abnormal. If focal same lumpectomy can be done with follow up. If Microcalcification are diffuse, we need to c if its benign r malignant, extent of involvement and later take a call on how much of Brest needs to be removed. Hope this information is helpfulThank u"
