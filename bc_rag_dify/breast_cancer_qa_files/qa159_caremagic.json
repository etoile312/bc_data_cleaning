  "Q": "Hi, my mother is 46 years old and is detected with uterus fibroid in the USG report. The size of the tumor is 3.61X3.62 cm. Its written hypo-echoic lesion . Is this a thing to worry if the uterus removal operation is done. Can this lead to cancer?or any other problem later on? My mother had breasts tumors 5 years ago and those were removed by operation.does that have anythng to do with her present problem?Pl help...I am very worried...",
  "A": "Hi and welcome to Chat Doctor. Usually ultrasound is accurate in detecting such tumors and most probably this is benign tumor as it says. Women who have had breast tumor in their medical history or in family have more chance of suffering from uterine and ovarian tumors. Fibroid or MoMA are benign lesions and malignant alteration is extremely rare. It can cause problems if grow up too much and cause bleeding or press surrounding structures. This isn't significant size and I recommend doing frequent check-ups and see is there rapid size progression or not. Uterus removal is also option and this is a routine procedure today. So you don't have to worry, cancer would have more intensive symptoms. Wish you good luck."
