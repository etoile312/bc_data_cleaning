  "Q": "My husband has a large mass in his left breast and another is forming in the right. He has had a sonogram on the breasts showing the masses. His left is worse, swollen, red and very painful. His right is just starting to feel that way. The doctor just did a biopsy of the mass. I have been trying to read about MALE Mastitis however there is no real information. How does it get treated if in fact that is what it is and not inflammation cancer. My husband is 41 and very out of shape and over weight.",
  "A": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. Most common cause for breast mass in males is breast abscess and breast cancer. Since his breast mass is painful, swollen and red, possibility of breast abscess (infection) is more. Best treatment for this is incision and Chat Doctor.  If Biopsy is suggestive of cancer then he will need modified radical mastectomy (MRM). So collect Biopsy report and discuss all these with his doctor. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wishing good health to your husband. Thanks."
