  "Q": "My sister in law had breast cancer and finished treatment about 6 months ago with herceptin the final stage.  She had had a bad back for a few weeks and has had a scan and been told that she had cancer in the back - not sure where else.  She is very private - acts as though all is ok - however I fear the worst - on this limited info can you give me some guidance please?",
  "A": "Breast cancer most commonly spreads to bones. Her attitude \"all is ok\", is good, having a positive outlook for a cancer patient gives them a very good quality of life. Evalauting further with a PET scan can give information on if it has spread elsewhere. Second line Chemotherapy is available and bisphosphonates are also recommended. If the pain in her back is worsening after the above options, she would need a surgical assessment for stability of the affected region, followed by radiation for pain control."
