  "Q": "I am a 21 yr old female and have 2 children I had a normal breast exam 4 months ago but i was doing a breast exam at home yesterday(i usually do not do them) and found a lump on the right breast next to the sternum its about 1/2 in next to the sternum.was wondering if i should be very concerned?",
  "A": "HiT hanks for your query. This is good that you found a lump.Self-examination saves many lives, and you should do this frequently. As per your history the lumps is of a short duration so the possibility of this having a cancer is very, very less, and you are young enough. Breast cancers do not occur usually at such an early age. The most probable diagnosis is fibrotic disease or fibroadenomas. I would advise you to undergo: MammographyUltrasonographyFNAC- fine needle aspiration cytology to get an accurate diagnosis. Take the medicines as per clinical presentation as seen by a Surgeon or Oncologist"
