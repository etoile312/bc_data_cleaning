  "Q": "hi i have done everything to cheek out my breasts but i feel like im unsure if i actually have breast cancer or not im worried and i want to tell my mother but i have already had a discussion about it and she just told me what to do. i really want to see someone to cheek my breasts to see if i have breast cancer im 16 years old and i dont want to see my doctor but is there anyone else i could go to??",
  "A": "Hi and welcome to Chat Doctor. Why do you think you have breast cancer? You are anxious about something that is irrational. It is almost impossible to have cancer at this age. You should stop even think of it. Have you ever heard that such young girl had breast cancer? You want to do mammography and risk irradiation because of it? There is no doctor in the world who will say anything else. Just enjoy in your life and don't have such absurd things on your mind. Wish you good health."
