  "A": "Hello, Anastrozole is used to treat breast cancer in women after menopause. Some breast cancers are made to grow faster by a natural hormone called estrogen.  Anastrozole decreases the amount of estrogen the body makes and helps to slow or reverse the growth of these breast cancers. Hot flashes, headache, trouble sleeping, dizziness, stomach upset, nausea/vomiting, constipation, diarrhea, loss of appetite, weight gain, tiredness/weakness, increased coughing, or sore throat may occur.  If any of these effects last or get worse, tell your doctor promptly. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Take care Chat Doctor. "
