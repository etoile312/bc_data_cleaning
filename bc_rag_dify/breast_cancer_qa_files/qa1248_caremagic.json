  "Q": "I have a breast infection, some pus coming from beside the nipple. I have had breast abscesses twice, close together, 30 months ago. At that time I had extensive checks for underlying cause, scans, mammograms and biopsies, all showed nothing abnormal apart from the infection which cleared up. I had been having tingling nipples and produced a small amount of breast milk, which also stopped. I am 52 yrs old, no real menopausal symptoms, but have had some bad frontal headaches lately that do respond to pain killers. I do not appear to be producing milk at present.",
  "A": "HI Thanks for posting your query.  For your breast infection you need to take Antibiotic course. Before being started on Antibiotics I advise you to get a test called Pus culture sensitivity. This test will help in deciding which is the right Antibiotic for your breast Infection.  I also advise you to get Ultrasound of your breast, it will give the information on whether only antibiotics is enough or you need a Chat Doctor.  Kindly get the above-mentioned tests done and revert to me. Hope this information was useful to you."
