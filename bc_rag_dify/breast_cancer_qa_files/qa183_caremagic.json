  "A": "Hi. Thanks for your query and concern for your Mother. She has already undergone Hemithyroidectomy and Operation +RT + CT for Cancer of the breast. The causes of pain in the left lower abdomen can be due to Colitis, secondaries of the cancer in the abdomen. I would advise CT scan of the abdomen and Colonoscopy to find out the actual reasons so that further treatment can be planned . The cause of the pain behind the right ear can be again a lymph node due to secondary of the cancer or a muscle spam . Clinical examination and FNAC will help to get a right diagnosis."
