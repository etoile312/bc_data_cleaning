  "A": "Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. You have multiple enlarged lymph node.  It is mostly due to metastatic carcinoma.  You have abnormal demography, so you have chances of breast cancer.  Or you may have some other pathology.  Go for ct scan as you advised.  Then you should take treatment accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health."
