  "Q": "I have chronic pain, but especially at night, in my hips from liposuction related to breast cancer surgery reconstruction. It was done by an excellent plastic surgeon at UTSW Med Center in Dallas in 11/11. I think maybe some nerve damage resulted and I am looking for relief to sleep better. My internist is suggesting 100MG of Gabapentin, and I am hoping not to have side-effects that I read about.",
  "A": "Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum.  It appears that you have some to the nerves, in the hip area. It also may be due to the loss of supports near the nerves so having pressure from other sides and causing the pain.  Avoid taking potato, other tubers, tomato, egg, chicken, and seafoods till the pain is relieved. As someone says you can use Gabapentin for relief.  I usually prescribe to my patient with such symptoms neurotrophic injections for 10 consecutive days, and then periodically. Ofloxacin diclofenac sodium, and paracetamol.  Wishing for a quick and complete recovery. Thank you."
