  "Q": "I am a 56 year old woman and a few weeks ago had a pimple under my left nipple. When it popped, a white pastie discharge came out. I had no more problems. Yesterday I noticed my nipple is flat and there is a lump behind it. It is somewhat tender and the area is soft but feel itchy all the time.",
  "A": "Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. You may have some fibrotic disease of breast.  Or you may have breast cancer. Chances of cancer is very low, but we should investigate for that. You should go for fine needle aspiration cytology. It will give perfect idea about diagnosis.  Then you should take treatment according to your diagnosis. Consult your doctor and take treatment accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health."
