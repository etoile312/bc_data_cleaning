  "Q": "I want to know if I should be taking any hormonal therapy to prevent recurrence of low grade stage 2a (3 cm. tumour) NO M0 early breast cancer treated in 2011 while I wait for a total hysterectomy scheduled for October 2013 to treat well-differentiated endometrioid adenocarcinoma with squamous differentiation diagnosed by endometrial biopsy.  I am a white postmenopausal woman aged 55.  My oncologist told me to stop taking Tamoxifen 20 mg daily since my diagnosis for uterine cancer in July 2013.  I would appreciate medical literature references, too.",
  "A": "Hormonal therapy is normally recommended for 5 years. One of the side effects of Tamoxifen is uterine carcinoma which has happened in your case. In such cases Tamoxifen is stopped and a total hysterectomy with bilateral oophorectomy is done at the earliest and Tamoxifen restarted. It is not advisable either to stop Tamoxifen for 4 months or to continue taking it in the presence of uterine cancer. So my advice to you would be to get the hysterectomy done at the earliest rather than waiting till October and then restart Tamoxifen. All the references can be had from nccn.org"
