  "A": "Hi, I am not sure how this site allows doctors to see reports, Because I see no options to see any reportsHowever, it appears that you want to lose weight and is inclined to use Chat Doctor diet for the same. However, the question first arise is \"whether Chat Doctor diet is effective\". This type of diet is often prescribed with low calorie which is the real cause of wight loss achieved. As far as your question goes, exogenous Chat Doctor is never proved to be free from side effects. You pituitary gonadal axis may get suppressed though this effect is more pronounced in males. Moreover, it should be avoided in hormone dependent cancers like breast and prostate know that you are neither male nor breast cancer case, but I strongly suggest against taking exogenous Chat Doctor for weight loss, which can be achieved with planned diet and exercise program"
