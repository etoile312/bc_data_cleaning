  "Q": "I am a 51-year-old female and a social smoker/drinker.  About a month ago, I started experiencing a sensation of my heart flipping, with an urge to cough.  I have had breast cancer (2002) and radiation treatements where they attempted to not involve my heart or lungs, yet they were unable to avoid them completely.  I have been nauseated as well as lightheaded as well during some of the \"flipping\" episodes.   I work for a Mayor, who is also an MD (GYN).  Should I have him recommend a specialist?",
  "A": "Well come to ChatDoctorThank for asking Your concern being appreciated, of course you can seek higher opinion as long as the history of malignancy is there, but it is not the cough that needed such opinion, but it could be allergic condition, if this is the not chronic one it may not be due to the heart unless you have some valvular heart disease, even the nausea and lightness may not be the serious condition and related with the malignancy, but it could be acid peptic disease, anxiety depression, hypoglycemia hope this information helps."
