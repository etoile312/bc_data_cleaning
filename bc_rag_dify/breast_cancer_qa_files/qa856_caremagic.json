  "A": "Hi there, I have understood your concern. I will suggest you the best possible treatment options. Basically, missing period is the most important sign of pregnancy.  If you have got your periods, even if they are 4 days late, you can very well assume that you are not pregnant. In case you still have doubts, please get mornings first sample of urine tested for pregnancy. In case of doubt blood beta Chat Doctor test and USG will be of help. I hope this answer helps you.
