  "Q": "Hi, i need some advise please, my partner has been poorly since monday evening and wont let me take him to see a doctor.  his whole body is aching and keeps going hot and cold.  At night he sweats so much the covers are soaked, He is quite a large guy and normally loves his food and beer but has gone off both.  Please advise, many thanks. Wendy",
  "A": "Hello, He might be suffering from some infection due to which he is having a loss of appetite and body aches. Please advise him to do a mammogram blood test at least to rule out viral or bacterial infection. Then accordingly treatment can be given. Mammogram blood test is a minimal requirement. Then follow up with reports to a local doctor. He will advise as per reports. Also rule out whether he is having any stress or anxiety could lead to depression and night sweats and depression, but that after ruling out an infection. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. "
