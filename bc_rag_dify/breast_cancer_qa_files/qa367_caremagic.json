  "Q": "Hello Dr Thakwani, My mother was diagnosed to have breast cancer (Right- mucous carcinoma), the FNAC suggested. When consulted with the surgical oncologist, he suggested to get total mastectomy with axillary dissection. A PET-CT scan was done at 5:30AM in the morning & an operation was carried out at 4PM same day (I m not sure if this is right, getting the reports & operation on the same day). The PET-CT scan report says Mutiple poorly enhacing soft tissue densities in the upper & inner quadrant of right breast, a few small right axillary nodes not significant by size criteria & no distant metastases . Bone scan report says No evidence of skeletal metastases. Histopathology report says Multifocal mucinous carcinoma grade 1 of right breast, base of resection is free of tumour, all 18 axillary lymph nodes are free of tumor, ER-Positive, PgR- Positive, Her-2/neu - Negative The fuild (serum) comming out from the operated region post operation was heavy 350ml,300ml...on the 5th, 6th, 7th day of post operation it was 220,200,180ml respectively. we were very much concerned about this but the doctor assertained that there was nothing to worry. My mom was refer to another medical oncologist by the surgical oncologist after 1month of operation to consult on whether to go for chemotherapy or harmone therapy My mom had no other illness, diabeties, BP except that had hypothyroidism for which she was taking thyroid tablets early in the morning before breakfast and varicose vein. Her age being 56yrs. The medical oncologist suggested her to take 4 cycles of chemotherapy & later take harmone therapy. But just after 3 days of the first chemotherapy my mom passed away with breathlessness & low-BP. Please explain me the cause, since except for the threatment she was hail & healthy & within one month of diagnosis of breast cancer & threatment we had to lose her & it has disturbed us soo much that we are still in a state of shock",
  "A": "Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. Sorry to hear about your mother. She had breast cancer.  It was just stage 1 cancer without lymph node or distant metastasis.  Her surgical margin and base are free from tumor.  So chances of death due to cancer itself is very rare.  But she may have some complications after surgery.  Pulmonary embolism or some other complications can lead to sudden death.  Sorry for her but this can happen sometimes.  Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health."
