  "A": "Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. At age of 13 breast cancer is very unlikely and chances are almost negligible.  You may have fibroadenoma or fibroadenomas.  Your mood swings are due to hormonal changes. It is not due to breast cancer.  Consult your doctor and go for examination.  If needed go for fine needle aspiration cytology or biopsy of breast lump and take treatment accordingly.  It is not breast cancer so don't worry about that. Just be relaxed. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health."
