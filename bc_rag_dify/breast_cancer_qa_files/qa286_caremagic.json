  "Q": "Hi, I have been having a tightness on the side of my breast, also i have been having like mild pain under my breast basically where the rib cage is and also this morning i felt a few sharp needle picks in my breast. I do not understand what might be going on. Any suggestion. I am a 32 yr old female and has never had this problem before.",
  "A": "Hi thanks for asking question. Here are few possibilities.1.large heavy breast with improper sleep posture or trauma to breast can lead to pain. Simple analgesic taken for it.2. Examine your breast, if during palpation mass or nodule felt then possibilities of fibroadenoma like lesion.FNAC needed if mass present.3.if associated nipple discharge present duct Eurasia can be thought. So examine your breast for any mass and if symptoms increasing then ultrasound, x-ray or mammography may need depending upon examination and follow up of patient. I hope my suggestion will help you"
