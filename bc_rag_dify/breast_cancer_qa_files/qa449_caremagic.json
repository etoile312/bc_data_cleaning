  "Q": "I had mastectomy done in May 2010 for a stage 1 invasive carcinoma. I did not have any chemo done except for tamoxiphen now I was told it returned in the same site of mastectomy sitting on the chest wall muscle grade III was are my options for treatment chemotherapy or radiation",
  "A": "Mastectomy scar recurrences involving underlying muscle are difficult to treat. You need to have complete staging workup to be sure there is no evidence of metastasis elsewhere in the body, and it is a localized disease. For a localized disease I would suggest neoadjuvant chemotherapy to shrink (downsize) the tumor followed by surgical resection and radiation therapy. Have the estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and Her2 new receptor status checked on the biopsy sample. It will help in guiding further treatment. I hope it helps. Please discuss it with your treating oncologist."
