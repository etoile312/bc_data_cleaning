  "Q": "I had a fall about a year ago and landed on my right breast.  2 days ago I found a lump in that breast - could it be related to the fall or is it likely to be cancer?  Im 43, in good health, Ive never been pregnant and have no pain or nipple discharge.",
  "A": "Welcome to Chat Doctor .1. It could be just a lump you have noted. Not necessarily to be a cancer.2. Howevere you can not ignore at all, In 40s cancer can not be ruled out, unless until proven.3. Get an appointment with your doctor and let the doctor examine and indicate an ultrasound scan (it will exactly figure out the nature of the lump and its involvement in the breast tissue)4. I don't think it's something related to the fall.5. Get examined, hope it helps you. Wish you good health. Anything to ask ? Do not hesitate. Thank you."
