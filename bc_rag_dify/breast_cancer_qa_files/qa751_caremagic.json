  "Q": "I have a grape-sized lump behind my ear. It feels like it s on the gland. It s immobile, and I wouldn t call it painful, but I definitely feel a tightness and pressure. I don t have insurance or the money to see a doctor. Also three weeks before I noticed this lump, a small lump came up on my areola, right next to my nipple. This one is smaller and rubbery, but also immobile. What should I do? I am 26, I weigh 127 lbs.",
  "A": "Hi.based from your description, it could possibly be a breast cyst, a fibrous (fibrous tissue formation) or fibrotic breast changes. It is best if you consult with a doctor, preferably a general surgeon, for medical and physical examination. Diagnostics such as breast ultrasound may also be needed for further evaluation of the mass. Management (medical and/or surgical) will be directed accordingly. Hope this helps. Good day!!~ Chat Doctor. "
