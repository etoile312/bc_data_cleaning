  "Q": "I have a reoccurring rash that develops in my groin area after periods of excessive sweating and it can be quite painful if I have to walk around when it has flared up. It has gotten to be more persistent as Ive gotten older. How can I treat or avoid this?",
  "A": "Hello. Thank you for writing to us at Chat Doctor I would keep a possibility of Intertwine, which is inflammation of the body folds. Intertwine clinically presents as red, moist, scaly, sore patches of skin on closely opposed body folds like maxilla, groins, submammary folds etc. Closely opposing body folds trap sweat and moisture and therefore make the area prone to inflammation from rubbing against each other. Candidal infection may superimpose (Candida Intertwine) thereby exacerbating the inflammation (redness and soreness). You may use an OTC topical antifungal e.g. clotrimazole 1% cream, twice daily in the affected folds for 4- 6Â weeks. If I was the treating doctor I would have also started you on oral antifungals e.g. Oral Fluconazole, in addition to the topical antifungal cream for 4-6 weeksOral antifungals are faster acting and better in controlling the candida super infection. Oral antifungals are prescription Chat Doctor. Once the condition has improved significantly on topical and oral antifungals (usually within 2-4 weeks), you may use an antifungal dusting powder e.g. clotrimazole dusting powder in the folds, twice daily, for maintenance of improvement. An antifungal dusting powder not only keep the folds "
