  "A": "Thank you for your question. Yes painful urination following prostate cancer treatment is not uncommon however should be investigated well.1. Urinalysis confirm if there is infection.2. CT scan and or ultrasound of pelvis to check if there is regrowth of prostate cancer.3.PSA level 4. Full mammogram to check for amount of blood and bacterial infection. Treatment Will depend on the results. Consulting urologist and oncologist will be helpful."
