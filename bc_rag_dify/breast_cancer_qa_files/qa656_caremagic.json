  "Q": "I have stage 1 breast cancer, non invasive of lymph nodes, had surgery to remove cells, followed by radiation. Now on Femara for about a month. I am 78 years old but been very active, ballroom dancing and competitions. I seem to have a sense of desperation, maybe just depression. I can t decide if it is just a normal reaction to all I have been through or the Femara that I have been taking. Lost interest in dancing and really uncomfortable around other people. Will see my doctor in about a week, do you advise trying another form of the pill I am taking?",
  "A": "Hi, Thanks for writing in. Femara is an aromatize inhibitor approved FDA to treat breast cancer in the following groups of patients(i) Postmenopausal women diagnosed with hormone-receptor-positive, early-stage breast cancer right after surgery (or possibly chemotherapy and radiation) to reduce the risk of the cancer coming back(ii) Postmenopausal women diagnosed with hormone-receptor-positive early-stage breast cancer who have taken 5 years of tamoxifen to reduce the risk of the cancer coming back(iii) Postmenopausal women diagnosed with advanced-stage or metastatic hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer It is important to know that Female won't work on hormone-receptor-negative breast cancer. Your cancer is receptor positive therefore you have been recommended to tale Female. It can cause tiredness and weakness in bones and not an emergency. Please discuss with your doctor."
