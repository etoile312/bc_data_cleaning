  "Q": "hello, i just had a double mastectomy with following reconstruction. I have spacers in and just had 1 fill so far of 60cc. I am now facing chemo. My tumor was her2 positive but stage 1 and only 1 cm. My nobes was clear of no cancer. Why am I having to have chemo (6) sessions?",
  "A": "Any breast cancer 1Â cm or more in size needs systemic therapy. Your tumor is Her2 new positive which makes it an aggressive tumor. Since You have not mentioned, I presume the tumor to be estrogen and progesterone receptor negative which rules out hormonal therapy. So the systemic therapy in your case has to be chemotherapy to kill any residual or circulating microscopic tumor cells which may not be visible on imaging at present. I hope your query has been answered."
