  "Q": "hi... i had clomid on dec i dnt get my periods for 53days of my cycle bt my hpt is -ve am worried am i pregant or not",
  "A": "Hi;welcome to HeatlhcareMagicIf the pregnancy test is negative and if you do not have any symptom like nausea;vomiting;giddiness;sick feeling;breast tenderness inspire of missing periods then you may not be pregnant. Absence of menses can be due to hormonal imbalance;ovarian cyst or any other cause and not necessarily due to pregnancy. If you are still worried you can consult a Gynecologist for examination, and she will do what is necessary for you. Thanks"
