  "Q": "I am a 60 y/o female post stage 2 estrogen postive invasive ductile carcinoma patient who went through 4 courses of taxotere and cytoxin chemo and 28 radiation treatments with 5 boost treatments for a total of 31, following a lumpectomy and negative lymph node removal.  I just had a chest CT which should a liver lesion and cyst.  Should there be reason for concern?  My liver enzymes are all normal at this point and my breast cancer seems to be gone as far as we can tell.  Thank you",
  "A": "Dear Ma'am, Sorry to hear about your problem. A liver lesion post breast cancer treatment can be a source of worry. The only way to confirm whether it is metastatic or not is to get a PET scan or a biopsy of the lesion. The other cyst in the liver is not a cause of concern. You should schedule an appointment with your oncologist and discuss the options with him. Hoping for the best. Please feel free to clarify any other query. Rohan KhandelwalBreast Oncologist"
