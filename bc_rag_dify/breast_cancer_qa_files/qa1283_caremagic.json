  "Q": "How can my family history of cancer effect my chances.  My father died for Lung Cancer and also had prostate.  My Mom had Colon but survived, my Brother died of Brain Cancer, two Aunts on Fathers side died of Breast Cancer and one on my mothers.  Two uncles on Moms side had lymphoma, one survived the other was murdered while still ill.  Is there a TEST and does Insurance cover it?",
  "A": "Hello Friend, From the history, I understand that there is a strong family history of cancer in you. As a doctor, I have to admit that the incidence and chance of developing cancer is on the increase in such patients. But I would like to give you hope because I am a Homeopath and in Homeopathy, there is definite plan of treatment in such cases and such disease tendencies can be corrected using genetic constitutional remedies. An expert Homeopath can very well remove the disease tendency in you and also keep you in perfect health preventing not only cancer, but any serious disease in the future. Our case taking would suffice and there are advanced investigations which are not needed for a Homeopath to prevent such disease tendencies. Best wishes to you. Do not get panicky which is an important cause for the precipitation of such serious diseases."
