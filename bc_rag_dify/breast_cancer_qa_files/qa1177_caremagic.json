  "Q": "My 57-year old sister just finished chemo and radiation for triple negative breast cancer. Her blood work showed alkaline phosphatase level is still high. She had a liver, ki dney, gallbladder and pancreas ultrasound. It showed a 3.4 cm cyst on her liver. Will have MRI tomorrow. I was diagnosed with Primary Biliary Cirrhosis 3 years ago and take Ursodiol -last liver ultrasound was normal. Our dad had colon and kidney cancer. How do I sort this out?",
  "A": "Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. Your sister has triple negative breast cancer.  Now she has liver cyst.  It can be hematoma, amoebic cyst, hydrated cyst, myogenic liver abscess or liver metastasis.  She should go for MRI. If needed go for ultrasound guided FNAC.  It will give you exact diagnosis. Then she should take treatment according to diagnosis. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health."
