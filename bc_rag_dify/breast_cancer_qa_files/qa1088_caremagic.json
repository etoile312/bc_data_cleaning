Diagnosed 4 months back with high sugar levels and advised to administer insulin regularly.Please advise, what should my wife do immediately to ensure she is not getting any infection from her moms used insulin needle? Thanx",
  "A": "Good day, and thanks for your question.  From your story the only transmissible infection your wife can contract from her mother is Hepatitis C. Asthma, breast cancer and high sugar levels cannot be transmitted through needle prick. However, the risk of contracting hepatitis C via needle prick (insulin needle) is extremely low. No need to panic my dear brother. However, you can take her to the hospital, she will do a baseline test on Hepatitis C (Antioch and liver function test especially alpine amino transferase) and the test is repeated 4-6 weeks after. Hope it helps. Thank you."
