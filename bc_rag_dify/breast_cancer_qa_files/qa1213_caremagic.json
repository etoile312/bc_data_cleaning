  "Q": "My serology report CMV ab-IgG 371.9 but others are negative. In histo pathology report impression : deficient secretory endometrium , Leiomyoma . I have stage 4 endometriosis also. cronic Oopharitis and salphingitis; How can I make a baby? My husband s all reports normal.",
  "A": "Hi Melissa, Welcome to Chat Doctor. You have not mentioned the size of leiomyoma. If the fibroid are small then in pregnancy they may not create problem, but if they are large and multiple, then even after you conceive, progress of pregnancy will be hampered by these fibroid. In that case mastectomy is advisable. You have not mentioned the patency of the tubes. If both the tubes are blocked then natural conception is out of question. You could go for Invited Fertilization, where they will ripen your ovum by medicines and when mature retrieve it and mate it with your husbands sperm and introduce the fertilized egg into the uterine cavity where the pregnancy can progress naturally. Wish you all the best."
