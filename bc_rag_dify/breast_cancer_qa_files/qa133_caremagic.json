  "A": "Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. She has breast cancer with metastasis in brain. ITIS stage 4 disease.  No surgery will help at this stage.  Chemotherapy and radiotherapy can not cure the disease completely.  It is just used as palliative treatment.  Despite any treatment prognosis remains poor. Life expectancy is not good. Chemotherapy has its own side effects so avoid chemotherapy is the better option.  Consult your doctor and take treatment accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health."
