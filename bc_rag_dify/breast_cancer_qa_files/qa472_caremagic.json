  "Q": "I found a nodule in my left axilla this morning while showering, it is sensitive, but not an abscess or raised area. It is probably about a quarter of an inch deep and round, does not roll or move.  No history of breast cancer in my family, I have not been sick at all except general tiredness which I attribute to working too many hours.  I called a surgeon and they cant see me until the 12 of the month, what do you think?",
  "A": "Hi there, kindly tel exact how old are you. It matters a lot to know your exact age to say whether it is benign or malignant breast lump. And if you have a feeding mother there might be chances of abscess, or it's a lymph node enlargement. there are many conditions to rule out regarding your query!! So the only way I can suggest you is to visit a pathologist and get your FNAC done for confirmation."
