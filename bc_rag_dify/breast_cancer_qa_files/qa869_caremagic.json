  "Q": "I have like this lump in my armpit and it s very small like maybe half of a pea and it doesn t hurt unless I touch it and it s a bit hard and when I pressed it really hard like some weird water came out and it became smaller and I read online that it might be breast cancer or just an infection please help",
  "A": "Hello and welcome to Chat Doctor, A lump in the armpit is most commonly due to lymph node enlargement. Lymph node enlargement can occur due to infection or metastasis from breast cancer. Pain on pressing the lump is suggestive of infection. Water coming out of the swelling suggests infectious material coming out of the swelling. Examination of the breasts for any lump is also necessary. Thus, consult your primary healthcare provider for clinical assessment and thus management. Thanks and take care Chat Doctor. "
