  "Q": "MY DAUGHTER IN LAW HAD BREAST CANCER AND HAD BOTH HER BREASTS PLUS OTHER FEMALE ORGANS REMOVED BECAUSE SHE HAD THE BRCA GENE, SHE HAD CHEMO AND RADIUM AND NOW SHE HAS A LUMP ABOUT 5CM X 3CM IN THE PELVIC COULD THAT BE SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE BREAST CANCER.SHE HAD A STENT PUT IN BETWEEN HER BLADDER AND KIDNEYS AND HAS BEEN VOMITING EVER SINCE THE STENT WAS REMOVED.",
  "A": "Dear Ma'am, Sorry to hear about your daughter in laws problem. Considering her BRA positivity and the history of breast cancer, it is best to get this pelvic mass assessed thoroughly. She should ideally undergo a CT scan, which would characterize the mass further and help in decision-making. She should also consult her oncologist with the findings and probably get a FNAC (needle test) to rule out cancer. Hoping for the best. Rohan KhandelwalBreast Surgeon.docrohan.wordpress.com"
