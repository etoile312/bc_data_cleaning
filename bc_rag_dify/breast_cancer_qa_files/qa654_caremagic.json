  "A": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. Evian 400 is having vitamin E. It has no proven role in Fibroadenoma regression. You can take I for nutrition point of view otherwise for Fibroadenoma I won't recommend it. For your right breast lump, I think you should get done mammogram first. If It shows fat deposition then better to get done surgical removal of lump and send for Histopathology to rule out malignancy. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks."
