  "Q": "I am a female 46 years old and was diagnosed with significant DVT in upper left arm to my port in left chest. Port was placed in 9/2013 for chemo treatments for triple negative breast cancer. All chemo and radiation ended in March 2014. Oncologist prescribed 15 mg of Xarelto twice a day for 21 days and then switch to 20 mg for 6 months -- I have been on Xarelto for 7 days. Oncologist advised to only limit carrying and lifting with left arm. Are there any other precautions I should take (restrict physical activity, travel plans, diet changes, sex life)?",
  "A": "Actually, the main precaution that you should take is not to miss your medicine as prescribed by your doctor and not to discontinue without his advice. Restrict physical activity of the left arm, but otherwise continue your daily routine activities. In fact, include some form of exercise in your routine, such as walking, if your health permits. This keeps the blood in your system to continue flowing and prevent thrombus formation elsewhere."
