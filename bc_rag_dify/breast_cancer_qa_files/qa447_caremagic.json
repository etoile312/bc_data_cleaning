  "Q": "I went thru breast cancer lumpetomy on my right side, chemo, my own bone marrow transplant and radiation in 1999/2000.  So far all check ups have been good.  A little pre-skin cancer here and there.  Two to three weeks ago soon after a biopsy and freezing an area on my finger I noticed a lump on my wrist near where my pulse is taken on my left hand. This is about the size of a small marble and very hard.  It is only tender around the area after I have felt around the area, it does not move or wiggle and seems to be right on the bone.  Would this be a volar wrist ganglion?  Is this something I should be concerned about because of my history?  If it is something I need to have checked what type of doctor should a consult since everyone seems to be a specialist any more.",
