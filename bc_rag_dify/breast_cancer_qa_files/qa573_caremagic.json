  "Q": "good afternoon doc , my aunt is suffering with breast cancer from 15 yrs.now admitted in YASHODA HOSPITAL HYD. the doctors told that tumour cells have spread to entire body including brain. plz will u tell us how to get admitted in this instute.is there any treatment avalable ? patient age :48",
  "A": "Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. She has breast cancer with brain metastasis and metastasis in other part of body. It is stage 4 cancer. Surgery is not useful in this stage. So treatment options are chemotherapy and radiotherapy. But it will not cure the disease. It just works as palliative therapy. Despite all treatment prognosis remains poor. Life expectancy is not good. Sorry to say but it is fact. Consult your oncologist and plan accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have any doubts then contact me at bit.ly/ Chat Doctor. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health."
