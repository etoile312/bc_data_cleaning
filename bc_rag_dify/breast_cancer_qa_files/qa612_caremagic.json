  "A": "Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor, You are having Fibrotic disease OG breast, in which lumps are present, and they can be painful or tender this discomfort may change with changes in hormone level during periods. These are non-cancerous in nature, so please do not worry. You have already done mammography and sonography, and they also support your diagnosis. You should be examined by a Surgeon who can palpate typical cobblestone type in upper and outer qua Chat Doctor. If there are any suspicious lumps then only a fine needle biopsy or nipple fluid aspiration is done to rule out malignant lesion. Risk of cancer is there but very small fraction, only thing sometime it may be difficult to diagnose in presence of fibrotic disease. For pain local or systemic analgesic may be used, and treatment option are few but may be dopamine agonist and progestins. Take care Good luck"
