  "Q": "Hi Doctor, Good morning. I took nordette as an ecp after an unprotected sex last December 26 and 27. I took nordette at exactly 8:51pm of 27th and the second dose at 8:51am of 28th. Out of frustration, I took another dose. I felt very sleepy on the first two days after taking nordette. And until now, I feel breast tenderness and feels like sore, but I don t feel sleepy and tire anymore. Only this morning (seven days after the second dose), I bled and it was super dark, like dark brown to black. What could this mean? Please help me. Sincerely, Anne",
  "A": "Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum.  After the Corvette one will have the period like discharge, may be the dark, or not. Next month you will have period, only on this day.  There won't be bleeding on the previous day of the cycle.  The sleepy less may not have any relation with the pills.  Take more of green leafy vegetables, pulses, sprouts, and protein rich foods to have good health.  Wishing for a quick and complete recovery. Thank you."
