  "Q": "I m a 32 year old male and have had a knot about 3 inches to the inside of my right breast and about and inch up from my breast for several years. It doesn t hurt. But a few days ago I had one to come up on the back of my neck. I explain the place by...if you bend your head back like your looking up you make a crease where it bends. The spot is right below that crease. It is not sore either. What do you think they could be???",
  "A": "Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern.  Lump in your head may be posterior cervical lymph node due to some infection.  Your breast lump may be breast tumor or soft tissue tumor.  You should go for fine needle aspiration cytology. It will give you exact diagnosis.  Then you should take treatment accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health."
