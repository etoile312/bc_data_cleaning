  "A": "Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. Your wife has history of breast cancer and taken treatment.  Her current problem of heavy bleeding has no relation with breast cancer. She may have adenomyosis or fibroid in uterus, and it leads to heavy bleeding.  You should go for ultrasound abdomen and endometrial biopsy.  It will give you exact diagnosis. Then you should take treatment accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health."
