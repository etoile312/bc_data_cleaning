  "Q": "I hav been ill for 18mnths n getting worse.  I now have NO APPETITE Abdominal pain n Tenderness esp R side & into back at times, a burning near appendix esp during exercise, A PAINFUL & growing lump in L breast tissue very close to axilla. Had Gall bladder removed 12 mnths ago with stones & sludge. Other conditions are Liver Lesion 12mm lower left lobe. Diverticular disease & suspected Celiacs. I have noticed a change in my skin colour - i seem to appear \"tanned\" though i used to be fair skinned that can tan prior to being sick. My skin is very hot to touch MOST of the time. Ive had 11 breast biopsies & only 1 lumpectomy which contained ADH. PLEASE HELP ME?",
  "A": "Hi. Thanks for your query. Your have multiple problems of pain in abdomen, removed gall bladder, liver lesion, breast lumps biopsied FNAC so many times and diverticular disease and suspected celiac disease and tanned like skin. The major issue is the pain in the abdomen for which you should again get all the relevant tests like:CT scan of the abdomen, Colonoscopy. Diagnostic Laparoscopy. You have to get this diagnosed and treated so that you can get a relief and once this problem is over all your other problems may get solved. If the lump in the breast persists, get the lump removed for 2 reason:You get rid of the disease. You get the proper histo-patho report whether this is a cancer or not. It also looks that stress and anxiety have taken a toll of you, get treated this too, and symptomatic treatment with multivitamins and supplements as required."
