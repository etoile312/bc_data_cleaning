  "A": "Thank you for writing in Chat Doctor, if your breastfeeding the safest Chat Doctor.  Also you can have intramuscular demo injection and progesterone implants. All these have its own side effects which include irregular bleeding and amenorrhea. Acne, anxiety, dizziness,backache etc. risk of breast cancer is rare. This is the safest way for contraception in lactation, I would suggest the same. Femilon is a combined OCP (has estrogen and progesterone) which is not given to lactating mothers."
