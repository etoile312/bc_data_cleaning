  "Q": "had silicone breast implants about 32 years ago, to correct an imbalance in breast size due to scoliosis.  The implants have since ruptured, as confirmed by mammograms and sonograms. In the past year or two, I have experienced significant itching all over my body, with red welts, bumps and raised areas,  especially on my arms. Could the ruptured silicon be causing the itching?",
  "A": "Dear Ma'am, Sorry to hear about your problem. Have the ruptured implants been removed? If not, they should be dealt with immediately. Silicone can cause problems, but they are mainly in the local area. It is unlikely that silicone will lead to problems all over the body. For your symptoms, you should consult a dermatologist as they might be due to eczema or some generalized allergy. Hoping for the best."
