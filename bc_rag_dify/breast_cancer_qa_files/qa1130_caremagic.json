  "A": "Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. Many cancers have genetic etiology and runs in family.  Breast cancer is genetic and it can occur.  However, many other factors play role in that.  Periodically health check up is the way to detect it in very early stage if it occurs. But it has definite genetic predisposition. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health."
