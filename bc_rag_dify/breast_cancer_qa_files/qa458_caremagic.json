  "Q": "On July 21st 1995, at age 41, I had a right radical mastectomy that was a stage 3+. I had the aggressive breast cancer. December 8,1997 my breast cancer returned in lymph nodes in my right under arm area that was a stage 4. January 1998 the Bone Marrow Team in Indianapolis, IN I started an experimental autologous stem cell transplant. A group of nine Indianapolis doctors, the Mayo Clinic and John Hopkins all agreed my cancer would probably make a 3rd appearance. Since I found both of my original cancers, I was advised to be vigilant. Five weeks after the transplant and 6 weeks of radiation we were transferred to High Point, NC. I had double pneumonia in December of 2000. It scarred my lungs. January 2017 we retired and moved to Florida to be near our only child and her two sons. The master bathroom was full of Black Mold and the Kitchen had a couple of areas too. My new Hematologist/Oncologist told me I tested positive for Lupus. If my cancer returns and I have Lupus too, how could that impact my quality of life?",
  "A": "Hello, Having a positive antinuclear antibody does not conclude that you have lupus. Do you have the following symptoms? -Patchy hair loss, oral ulcers, and nasal ulcers. -History of seizures or strokes, blood clots, active joint pain, and stiffness. -Color changes with cold exposure and pain in the digits, skin rash and photosensitivity. Lupus diagnosis can be made only by putting together many of these criteria. I doubt you have lupus. You can see a rheumatologist to run the other tests for lupus too. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.  "
