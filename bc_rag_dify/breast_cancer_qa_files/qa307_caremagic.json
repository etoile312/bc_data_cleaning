  "Q": "helloI noticed a few nights ago when I was laying in bed with my husband, a lump in my left breast. I was laying on my right side when I noticed it and I was wondering should I have it checked out?is there a certain way I should lay down to check? I did lay on my back and felt it still. Recommended advice?",
  "A": "Hi, Welcome with your query to Chat Doctor virtual Clinic. I reviewed all the details of your query, in context of the breast lump. Based on the facts of your query, You seem to have Fibroadenoma /or Breast Mouse lump, as it is missed in routine examination and needs careful palpation of the breast. Other possibilities of -Fibroadenomas/or Early malignant breast lump needs to be ruled out after FNAC Biopsy with Hist- path examination / Mammography tests. Advise-Get the lump checked from Surgeon, who would investigate and fix the cause and would treat it accordingly. This needs to be checked with flat of your hand while lying or standing.Don't worry till the Homeopath report confirms the cause of this lump. Hope this reply would help you to plan treatment with your doctors and resolve your worries.
