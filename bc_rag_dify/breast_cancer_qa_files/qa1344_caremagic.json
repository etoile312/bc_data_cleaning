  "Q": "I was diagnosed with Stage1 Invasive Ductal breast cancer grade 3 triple negetive Brca1 and 2 negative. My tumor was 2mm. Very small my doctor said chemo wasn t needed due to the size..did lumpecty along with 33 radiation treatments. I done a lot of research on triple negative always chemo..what are your thoughts",
  "A": "In patients with Infiltrating Ductal Carcinoma - Triple Negative type, chemotherapy is almost always needed. However, as the size of the lesion in your particular instance is less than 5 mm (size mentioned is 2 mm) chemotherapy may be avoided. It may bet better for you to have a medical oncology consultation with all details being fed to Adjuvant Online! To find out the benefit of chemotherapy in your particular scenario. Other relevant history like family history, age and other parameters will also have a bearing on the final treatment decision."
