  "Q": "hello doctor ,my wife feel pain her breast and i check that her breast not that much hard but she feel pain but after little bit massage she feel relax but she fear that may be its symtoms of breast cancer..so can u plas advise me that what was that exactly.........",
  "A": "Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. She may have fibroadenomas or fibrotic disease.  Breast pain is common in this condition.  Pain is uncommon in cancer.  Symptoms of cancer are breast lump, weight loss etc. However to rule out cancer and to mental peace she should go for mammography once.  It will give exact idea regarding cause.  Then she should take treatment accordingly.  Don't worry much about cancer. Just be relaxed. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health."
