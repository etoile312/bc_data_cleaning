  "Q": "Hello doctor! I m a mother of three month old baby. From the very beginning I lacked sufficient milk. As a result I had to give him Nan Pro and then switched to Enfamil A with spoon. Later I was forced by elders of the family to use feeding bottle.gradually he has stopped suckling completely. How bad is it for both of us and is there any remedy?",
  "A": "Thanks for asking I have gone through your question and understand your concern you are mother of month of baby. Baby stopped to take your feed,breastfeeding has benefit for both for mother and baby. For baby it prevents many infections like diarrhea, pneumonia asthma and many other diseases. It also improves IQ of baby. For mother, it prevents from obesity, breast cancer .it is very time-consuming process to shift for bottle feeding to breastfeeding. To increase your breast milk you should be good nutrition with good amount of fluids in your diet (about 3-4 liter per day), take proper rest (2 hours in day is also recommended), have confidence that all mother who give birth have sufficient milk. Not to have anxiety that you have less milk production. You can take tab metaclopramide 10 mg thrice a day for 7 days to increase milk production. If he stops taking your milk, try try try and try your milk. When he will hungry he takes.  If he not takes your milk initially you can give by spoon. Main thing breastfeeding is confidence"
