  "Q": "I am 48, white female, 61\" tall, 150 lb.  Lobular carcinoma was found in the left breast which was stage II.  I had a bilateral simple mastectomy. I have several spots in the lungs and liver.  I completed 16 chemo treatments.  I had an EKG which was good, no respiratory problems.  I had one area in the lungs shrink after chemo treatments, but another \"hazy\" area appeared.  What could be the possible cause of the hazy areas?",
  "A": "Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. You have breast cancer.  It is of stage 2. So spots in lung and liver are not due to cancer.  Because if they are cancer spots then your cancer become stage 4. You should go for ct scan of chest with contrast.  It will give you exact diagnosis. Then you should take treatment accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health."
