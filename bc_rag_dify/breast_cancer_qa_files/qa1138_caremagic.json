  "Q": "Hello, my daughter aged 36 has just had a mammagram & ultra sound which showed no problems, she then had a biopsy as she has quite a large swollen lymph node under her armpit, it has been there 2/3 mths she was given antibiotics a month ago but did not help. My daughter says that it throbs sometimes and she is feeling not well. She has breast implants (behind the muscle) three yrs ago. Recently she has been taking amphetamines (prescribed slimming pills) could they have anything to do with the lymph node? She is beside herself as my grandmother died of lymphatic leukemia. Also what percentage of biopsies show positive for cancer? Would appreciate an honest straightforward answer, (I m sure you do anyway) thanking you in advance, from mum who loves her daughter from the bottom of my heart regards M",
  "A": "Hi, I value your concern regarding the symptoms. I have gone through your symptoms, and in my opinion your concern is valid, the lymph nodes are usually either due to infection or as times due to malignancy, and breast and lymph carcinomas are one of the main causes, the best way out is to remove one node and get a biopsy done to clear all doubts. Hope this answers your question. If you have additional questions or follow-up questions then please do not hesitate in writing to us. I will be happy to answer your questions. Wishing you good health. Special note-Any medication prescribed needs to be taken after consultation with your personal doctor only."
