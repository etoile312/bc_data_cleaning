  "Q": "Pain in left upper breast all day long saw my Dr and had a mammogram and a chest x ray everything normal went to a heart Dr and had a stress test and a echo done everyhing normal but some times my chest hurts all day Ithink it is angina my mother had it but she is no longer here  Im 64 years old .",
  "A": "Hello, I have gone through your query. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Since your echo and stress testing are normal your pain is unlikely to be due to angina. Your x-ray chest and mammogram have ruled out other chest conditions. So your pain may be due to Acid reflux. Partly there us contribution of fear of this pain being angina !you may take combination of Omeprazole and risperidone once a day. If your pain does not subside within few days you should consult your physician for further evaluation like Ultrasound upper abdomen and Upper GU endoscopy, My best wishes Chat Doctor. "
