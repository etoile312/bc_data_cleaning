  "Q": "Hello, I have discovered a 6 inch x 7 inch soft mass situated just left of my spine slightly below my shoulder blade. It is soft with a firmer center, non painful to touch, but I have had multiple symptoms that I have attibuted to other things....numbness in my left arm and hand, hot cold flashes, burning pain in my shoulder and neck as well as an increase in headaches. There is some area deep in my chest that at times does cause pain when I move a certain way or lift my arm it sort of takes my breath away. I have degenerative disc and history of headaches so wasn t too concerned. This is especially stressful to me as we have alot of lung cancer as well as breast cancer in the immediate family. Thanks for your help.",
  "A": "Hello, From the history you have given, (a really lucid one), the soft mass below your shoulder blade seems to be similar to a lipoma, which is nothing but accumulation of fat. The exact diagnosis can be given by the attending physician on examining it in detail. And your headaches and the numbness and burning sensations in the arm all seem to be the direct effects of the cervical disc degeneration which you have already been ad Chat Doctor.  So a good posture and physiotherapy should help you. The chest pain aggravated on movement can mostly be a musculoskeletal one with inflammation of the rib joints. Though these symptoms do not seem to be associated with the family history of cancers, I would suggest you to get evaluated for the swelling, probably an ultrasound of the swelling can give a clue. The X-rays for the neck and chest can rule out any other suspicions. Talk to your physician about the family history of cancers and he might deem it necessary to screen you for the same if he suspects any from the complete history and examination findings. You can be reassured about the concerns of cancer. Take care! Hope everything goes on well!"
