  "Q": "I am on line looking for information about chemotherapy and arthritis.  I have a Dr.s appt with a specialist on Tuesday.  I am currently taking Herceptin for breast cancer.  For the last 2 mo I have had shoulder pain.  It is moving into my hips.  A MRi revealed enough for me to be sent to an orthopedic man.  I have two more herceptin treatments to go.  I am also on Aremidex.  Most of what I am seeing I dont like.  It concerns me.",
  "A": "Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. Treatment of breast cancer depends on stage of cancer.  Chemotherapy and radiotherapy with surgery is the treatment of choice.  If hormone receptors are positive then Herceptin is useful. You should continue your treatment for breast cancer.  For arthritis steroids or analgesic plus any inflammatory Chat Doctor.  Consult your doctor and take treatment accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health."
