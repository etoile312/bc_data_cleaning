  "Q": "Hi, My right arm has been sore for the last two days, and when I got undressed, I thought I felt a lump and im trying to find it i cant. I have breast cancer on the left side, and im in remission, and I have the her2+ and it was in nodes. Does cancer hurt? my last spot was on my chest wall and didnt hurt, but Im not sure",
  "A": "Hi, Thanks for writing in. It is important to do a complete evaluation for the sore right arm. There are many possibilities including an infection or a clot in the veins of the arm. This requires a Doppler scan of the affected arm. Please consult your doctor and get a clinical assessment done. Should you require a Doppler scan then please get it done immediately? Ant serious cause should be detected at the earliest and treatment started without delay or progress of the condition. Please do not worry."
