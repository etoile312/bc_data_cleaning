  "A": "Welcome to Chat Doctor. 1. The history and symptoms suggest the possible cause could be breast abscess which is of infective etiology - painful sore breast.2. In case of hard and not very painful the causes all be breast cyst, ductal Eurasia, mass lesions.3. In any case you need to get an ultrasound examination done which will evaluate the nature of the lump its source and extensions.4.in case of mass lesion an FNAC - fine needle aspiration cytology need to be done to know the nature of the cells involved. Depending on the age mammogram correlation needed for the tiny / micro calcifications.5. Suggest to get appointment with your GP, get examined and needful investigations and treatment accordingly.
