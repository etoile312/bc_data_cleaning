  "Q": "I woke up this morning with a big lump in my right breast. The lump is as big as a golf ball. It is painful. I had this happened before about a year ago, the lump was in my left breast then and it was way bigger. I figured it was exposure to mold. You see, we rented a home in Missouri and they did not have a good air circulation. As a matter of fact no windows in the bathroom and the exhaust fan was not working. After each shower, the carpet will feel damp. Few days later, a smell of mold (spores) became very strong. That s when the lump appeared. After we vacated the house, few days later the lump subsided and never returned. Will this be the same phenomenon? I am 49 years old, all my mammograms have been normal.mary Or should I see the doctor now?",
  "A": "Hello hope the answer helps you. As far as my understanding madam all your screening mammograms are normal but recurrently having painful breast lump I don't know whether associated with nipple discharge or any wearing ulcer there, and you found that after leaving that non-ventilated house it settled, but usually such infections are more common in diabetics and immunocompromised people if you are smoking it can cause inflammation of breast ducts and stasis of secretions as PERIRECTAL MASTITIS.you TRY A COURSE OF ANTIBIOTIC AS amaryllis plus clavulanic acid 1gm BD for 7 days with some analgesic and hot fomentation and soft bra wear take it out at night. If not settled madam than consult breast surgeon kindly"
