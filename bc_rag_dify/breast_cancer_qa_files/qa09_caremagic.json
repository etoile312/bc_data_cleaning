  "Q": "I had what I thought was an ingrown hair in my armpit pop up. After a few days it grew the size of a golf ball and continued to get bigger. It was so painful I couldn t move at all but put my arm in bent position curled against me. After going to the doctor she said it was a MRSA infection and opened it up and drained it. (I received the lab results back stating it was MRSA) Now, two weeks later, the bump under my arm is gone but I have something string like enabling me from fulling extending my arm above my head. You can feel the strings from my armpit past my elbow. I went back to the doctor and saw one of my doctors associates and he said I have something called Sporotrichosis and will need to be on an antibiotic for a couple of months. Does this sound right? I ve looked up Sporotrichosis and my arm doesn t look like that but I found AWS (Axillary Web Syndrome) and my arm does kind of look like that but I did NOT just have any breast cancer surgery.",
  "A": "Hi.Thanks for your query. Noted the history of enlargement of axillary lymph nodes with strings radiating from elbow to the maxilla like a web, axillary web syn Chat Doctor. With the history you have provided, this looks to be lymphangitis causing the strings under the skin from the elbow to the maxilla which has now enlarged lymph nodes. I would advise you the following in such a case as definite cause may not always be found and hence also called as Idiopathic. Blood smears to be prepared at midnight and examined for elephantiasis that is filariasis. Blood to be tested for CBC and other routine reports like sugar, kidney and liver functions. A course of an antibiotic and Albendazole to be started asap. A 3-week course of Genocide forte that is diethylcarbamazine helps. Give rest to the affected arm. Plenty of oral fluids orally to combat deny"
