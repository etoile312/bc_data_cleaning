  "Q": "what could it mean when small fingertip size moles on the outside 1/2 of 1 breast that appear suddenly? skin or brest cancer come to my mind, asking for a friend who is afraid to go to te doctor. there are more symptoms suddenly on her right breast?",
  "A": "Hi, Thanks for writing in. A fingertip sized mole over the skin needs to be investigated clinically even if it is most likely benign. Please consult your doctor without any fear. Without clinical examination it is not possible to guide you in the right direction. Since the moles are fingertip sized it is likely to be a little amount of increased pigmentation and can happen due to benign causes in most people. It is unlikely to be a breast cancer, and you can relax about it. Even the rare possibility of skin cancer persists only if there is sudden enlargement in the mole, rapid color change in the appearance, growth of hair on it or unexplained lumps anywhere else in the body. Please remember that delaying treatment might lead to complications in the rare possibility of it being a condition that requires immediate treatment. Please do not worry."
