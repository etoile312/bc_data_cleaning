  "Q": "Hi, I have noticed this evening it feels like there is a lump in my foodpipe some near my breastbone area. I work and attend university and have been very pressured, averaging 5 hours sleep a night and just recovering from a chest infection. This has never happened before, I am in my early forties.",
  "A": "Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. You may have breast lump or soft tissue tumor.  You should go for x-ray a chest and mammography.  If needed go for biopsy. It will give you exact diagnosis. Then you should take treatment accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health."
