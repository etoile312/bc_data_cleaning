  "Q": "I have burning in my left breasts.  I have been to my physicians, she has taken all the tests to see if it is breast cancer she says no.  I only seem to get this burning in july I had the same thing last year.  I took Lyrica and the pain went away.  This time it is lasting a little longer.  I also sweat alot only on my face and behind my neck. Is this cancer?",
  "A": "Dear Ma'am, Sorry to hear about your problem. Your symptoms are not suggestive of cancer. Burning can be due to hormonal changes. I am sure your physician would have ordered a mammography or sonomammography for you and if that is normal, you should not worry and just get regular screening done. For the sweating, you should visit a dermatologist. Hoping for the best. Please feel free to clarify any other query."
