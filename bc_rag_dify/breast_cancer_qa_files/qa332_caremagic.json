  "Q": "Hi, im a 16 year old female  and have been noticing the past week or 2 on the left side of my breast i have a discolored bump a little bigger than a dime. it doesnt hurt or itch. I was diagnosed with hashimotos disease a few years ago and even found out somewhere that i could be growing a third nipple..? please help me.",
  "A": "Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. Hashimotoss disease affect thyroid glands. It is not for breast. If you have any breast lump then you should go for examination and if needed go for biopsy of that lump. If you have any thyroid problem then go for T3, T4 and TSH level as well as ultrasound thyroid. Then you should take treatment accordingly. Hope I have answered your question. If you have any doubts then feel free to ask me. I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health."
