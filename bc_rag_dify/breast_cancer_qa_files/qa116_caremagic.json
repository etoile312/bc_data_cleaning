  "Q": "What are the criteria used to determine abnormality and possible malignancy in an ultrasound of an axiliary lymph node? When a scan leads to a biopsy, what factors typically were observed in the scan to suggest further testing? Should a doctor consider how long the lymphadenopathy has occured when considering if a scan or biopsy should be done? For example, if a person has lived with frequent episodes swollen nodes for the last 17 years and has no health issues other than the node soreness, would this fact eliminate the suspicion that the current episode of inflammation is due to malignancy? Do doctors regard client reported information such as length of occurance as irrelevant hearsay? How can a normal node have an adjacent blood vessel or be vascular if these traits are indicitive of malignancy? What causes vascularity in a non cancerous node? Do do doctors err on the side of unnecessary biopsy to protect themselves against litigation? Can one tell from an ultrasound what type of cancer might be present in a lymph node? For example does metastasized cancer appear different from lymphoma, etc? Would breast implant related ALCL typically be present in nearby lymph nodes? Should a late onset seroma cause chronic (lasting 17 years)lymphadenopathy to be suspect for malignancy? If a person had a late onset seroma that resolved spontaneously after 4 weeks should a dr be less suspicious of ALCL in a subsequent seroma? Can sports activity related irritation in an implant capsule cause lymph node inflamation?",
  "A": "Lymphadenopathy is best evaluated with a biopsy when suspicious.it can be due malignancy, histiocytoses, granulators disorders, and storage diseases. Specific infections can be diagnosed if tissues are appropriately stained. Ultrasound features can be distinguishable for benign and malignant nodes but It's not always accurate. Vascularity can occur in benign and malignant nodes but the features and pattern of vascularity varies. Complex nodes like central necrosis or cystic regions are highly suspicious but again not 100% for malignant. Most chronic inflammatory condition increase the risk of malignancy. Breast implants and related irritation of tissues leads to lemonades. But again ruling out malignancy is essential as missing out on the suspicion can be life-threatening later on. Ultrasound cannot differentiate cancers lymphomas etc. they only guide the doctor for s biopsy or further imaging modalities. They help in making decisions."
