  "Q": "I have a rather large lump under my right arm and a smaller one under my left arm and it is only palpable when I lay down and put my arm over my head like I am doing a breast exam. It does not hurt and it doesnt move. the only time it hurts is if you push really hard on it. I am tired alot and wonder if I have to be concerend with breast or lung cancer ?",
  "A": "Hi there, the lump that you feel could be a lymph node or could be accessory mammary gland tissue. You should visit your physician and get a fine needle aspiration cytology done of the lump. This test is very simple, and it will be able to tell your physician the exact nature of the lump and whether you need to worry about it or not. Your tiredness could be due to lack of proper sleep or worrying about this lump. It is best to know its etiology and put your mind at rest then to speculate and worry about it Take care."
