  "Q": "I had breast cancer in 2005 - lumpectomy and 31 radiation treatments.Have a small red spot under the radiated breast that sometimes opens up but does not leak fluid - just sore.  Sometimes it disappears and then comes back.  Should I worry that this might be another cancer?",
  "A": "Hi, Thanks for writing in. It is always better to get a sore area in the breast clinically evaluated. Most are benign conditions, but a recurrence must always be ruled out if you had previous breast cancer and took treatment for it. Radiation causes changes below the skin and this might manifest as a sore. It is not essential for an infection to be discharging in the early stages. Though it appears to be a post lumpectomy and radiation change that has taken place, it is suggested that you consult your doctor and get ultrasound scan done to screen for any suspicious activity in your breast. Also, please feel your maxilla for any lymph node swelling and bring it to the notice of your doctors. Please do not worry."
