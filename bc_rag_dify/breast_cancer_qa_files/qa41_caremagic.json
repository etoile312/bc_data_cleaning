  "Q": "I have been having stabbing pains in my upper right abdomen. I had the procedure where the camera is put down your throat. The doctor found at least 10 polyps which she does not believe is cancer. She is doing a biopsy. She found my stomach is going into my esophagus which could mean cancer now or in the future. I did have breast cancer in 2012 & had a double mastectomy. She said the two would not be linked. I feel hungry all the time but after I eat I feel sick & bloated. I have a lot of dieareah as well. Ulcers have been ruled out. Could this be cancer?",
  "A": "Hello. We can't be sure until we get the biopsy report(biopsy of polyp). Stomach going into esophagus means it is a pre malignant condition.(barrels esophagus)You have to take a lot of measures to stop this condition. Did you get an ultrasound of abdomen and H.pylori text? Take PPI(as advised by your doctor)Avoid alcohol carbonated beverages smoking coffee etc. and other addictionsSleep after three hours after taking fondest curd or take probiotics Avoid spicy foods Take diet rich in fiber avoid refined foods/charred or salted foods for regular follow up with your doctor... If you have any more queries I would be happy to help you."
