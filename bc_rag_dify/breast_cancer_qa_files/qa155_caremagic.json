  "Q": "Hi I have a slightly dark brownish pigmentation of only one of my breast. It is around the lower fold, hasnt changed color or consistency, seems like lines and dots, doesnt itch or pain. I m 25, Indian subcontinent region, healthy, no previous health histories other than appendectomy. It is not acanthosis nigricans or PCOS related. Doesnt seem like a fungal or any infection. It as been there for about a month now. No trauma to the region as well.",
  "A": "Hi, Thanks for writing to us. Certain areas over body like groins, underarms, infra mammary areas(areas beneath breast) are prone to pigmentation due to friction, trapped sweat and thriving of fungus bacteria etc. So chances are the pigmentation in your case is due to friction. Abut definitely other conditions like acanthuses, fungal infection should be ruled out. If its just pigmentation, application of HY Chat Doctor. Hope this helped. Take care."
