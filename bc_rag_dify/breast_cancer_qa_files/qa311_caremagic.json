  "Q": "Hi, my wife,37, has just had 2 lumpectomy s to remove a stage 1 breast cancer. We are now awaiting the results of an Oncotype DX test to determine wether or not Chemo is to be used inconjunction with Tamoxifen and Radiation. The problem is she has an underlying Active Hep B virus which the count has increased since the last reading a year ago. Her specialist has advised her to start Viread for the Hep B, and once she starts the Viread, she has been told she can never miss a dose for life or it could pose a major health threat or death. If chemo is needed, she can t take the chemo without taking the Viread, and, research shows that 3 years using Viread is considered long term Which is confusing her about having chemo. Any suggestions?",
  "A": "The two things need to be tackled separately. Hepatitis B has its own course and treatment and breast cancer treatment has its own course. Stage 1 breast cancer is managed by lumpectomy and followed by hormone therapy if ER, PR assays are strongly positive. She can even be considered for oophorectomy to reduce the estrogen level. Other modes of treatment can be kept standby if the tumor is of low grade."
