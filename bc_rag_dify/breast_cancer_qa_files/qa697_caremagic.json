  "A": "Hello misunderstand your concerns pill give 95 percent protection if taken with in 24 hours after sex.Sometimes it can be given for safety in UN protective sex to prevent unwanted pregnancy. Do not worry it cause minor side effects like nausea, breast tenderness/soreness, tiredness, delay in period for 5-7 days, with Chat Doctor. So do not worry does not any major problem if you took unnecessarily. If period will delay by more than 10-12 days then go for pregnancy confirmation as it has 5 percent failure rate. Hope this may help you Best regards"
