  "A": "Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern.  She has ductal carcinoma of breast.  Stage 2 with no metastasis.  She has already gone through surgery.  Noe she should take chemotherapy.  She should also check for ER, PR and her 2 new. If this receptor is positive then receptor specific antagonist treatment is very useful in breast cancer. Consult your doctor and take treatment accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health."
