  "Q": "In March 2012 I was diagnosed with breast cancer. Prior to that I went tanning all the time but when I was diagnosed I stopped. I went tanning for the first time today. The majority of my body is FRIED but then other areas had no problem even though i used the same lotion everywhere. I dont know if its connected to the cancer or not but im freezing, extremely nautious and parts of my body feel like they are on fire. Should I be concerned?",
  "A": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I want to ask you few questions s.1. Have to taken radiotherapy. 2. Have you taken injectable chemotherapy? 3. Are you on tamoxifen or other breast cancer Chat Doctor? If you had chemotherapy and radiotherapy for breast cancer than due to skin damage tanning is very common. And nausea is very well known complication of chemo and radiotherapy. If you are on tamoxifen than this can be a side effect of this "
