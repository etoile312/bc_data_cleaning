  "Q": "i have a 2 year old daughter. her left nipple is red & there s a lump under the skin... what is the difference between a swollen lymph node, an abscess & breast cancer? i ve heard of 4 years old girl in Toronto, Canada who had breast cancer... how long should i wait until i see the doctor?",
  "A": "Hi, Breast cancer is extremely rare in this age-we suspect when it gradually enlarges, painful, bloody discharge or irregularity of over lying skin. There are no lymph nodes immediately around breast tissue-we look for nodes in maxilla. Most commonly these are just physiological asymmetry between two sides rather than true lumps(some lumpy feeling underneath is common and indicates normal glandular tissue). When the overlying skin becomes red/shiny with pain/tenderness, this indicates development of an abscess needing antibiotics and occasionally Chat Doctor.  If you are still in doubt, kindly get it examined once to relieve anxiety, as our peace of mind is more important. Hope I have answered your question. Let me know if I can assist you further. "
