  "A": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. Breast cancer can spread by three ways. 1. Local spread 2. Lymphatic spread 3. Homogenous spread. Through homogenous spread, breast cancer involve distal organs like lung, liver, bones, brain etc. These are known as metastasis. So bone metastases are common in breast cancer patients. So your relative might be having metastatic bone cancer from primary breast cancer."
