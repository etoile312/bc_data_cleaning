  "Q": "i had my gallbladder removed Sept 2000 they did the 3 -4 small holes, since then i suffer with bouts of sever bloating , which stays mostly in my upper abdomen. i also have a lump just below my right breast that stays hard and fairly tender, but the rest of my upper abdomen and part of my lower swell up causing me to look as if i m 9 months pregnant. I ve stayed on a regular diet and do not eat foods like pork, eggs , sodas and avoid a lot of dairy products but it still happens. I also have problems with my bowl movements, sometimes i have none for 3 or 4 days then i have diarrhea for the next few days. So my questions is what could be causing this and should i be concerned?",
  "A": "Reclothe symptoms that you have described suggest that you have acidity and indigestion with possibility of intestinal infestation. You need to do two things first get that lump under your breast examined by a surgeon and get a stool examination. Meanwhile, you are doing good at maintaining a good diet, but you need to make sure that you indulge in good amount of physical exercise as well. You may visit a doctor who after examination may advise you a good antacid like omeprazole/pantoprazole with risperidone which will help you a lot. Please get your breast lump examined by a surgeonDont be too concerned though. Wishing you a speedy recoveryRegards"
