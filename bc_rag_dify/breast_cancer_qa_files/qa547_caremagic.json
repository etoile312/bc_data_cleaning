  "Q": "I am a 64 yr old woman about to undergo a mastectomy.While undergoing various other tests they discovered stones in my gall bladder.However there is no pain.The doctor has suggested removing the gall bladder via laparoscopy since I would already be undergoing the breast removal surgery.Should I go ahead or since theres no pain leave it as it is.Thank you!",
  "A": "Hi and welcome to Chat Doctor. It would be advisable to remove gallbladder if general anesthesia will be already performed. This would prevent any future difficulties due to gallbladder stones and procedure is routine today with negligible risk of complications. Of course, this is all up to you, but as I said there is more benefit than costs and I agree with your doctors about it. Thanks for the query. Regards"
