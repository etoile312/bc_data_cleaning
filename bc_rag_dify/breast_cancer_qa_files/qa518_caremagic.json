  "Q": "I had breast cancer 18 yrs ago. Over the last several months I have noticed increasing muscle weakness, SOB on exertion, foul tasting phlegm when I cough occasionally, pneumonia and several colds. I currently do not have a cough. Should I worry about metastisis to my lungs?",
  "A": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your situation and problem. Since you had breast cancer and pneumonia, following are the possible causes for your symptoms. 1. Post infectious bronchitis 2. Pulmonary metastases. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done 1. Clinical examination of respiratory system 2. CT thorax 3. PUT (Pulmonary Function Test). CT thorax is needed to rule out lung metastasis. PFT is needed to rule out bronchitis. So better to first diagnose yourself and then start appropriate treatment."
