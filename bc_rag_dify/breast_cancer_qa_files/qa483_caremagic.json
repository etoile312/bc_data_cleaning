  "Q": "I just received a flu shot yesterday and this morning I woke up with swelling of my lymph nodes under my armpit (the same side that I received the shot). I have a yearly mammogram done and do monthly checks but did not have this issue prior to the shot. Is this an adverse reaction? If so what can I do to alleviate the swelling and pain?",
  "A": "Hello, I understand your concern. I am Chat Doctor, infectious diseases specialist, answering your query. In my opinion you should not worry regarding your swelling in the lymph nodes. Flu shot do sent show this type of reaction. This can be something else. In my advice you should take cetirizine under your doctors' guidance. It looks like that this swelling is allergic reaction and does not require any further management. Only wait and watch is required to cure you. Please take good care of the swelling by taking good hygiene. Antibiotics can be taken to prevent secondary infection. I will be happy to answer your further concern, you can ask me on bit.ly/ Chat Doctor.  Thank you. ChatDoctorInfectious diseases specialist."
