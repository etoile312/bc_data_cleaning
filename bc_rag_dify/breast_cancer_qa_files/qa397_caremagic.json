  "A": "Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern.  You have breast lump with inward pulling of nipple and soreness. You may have fibroadenoma, fibrotic disease or breast cancer.  Mammography and biopsy is diagnostic.  Please send me your reports of mammography and biopsy.  It gives you exact diagnosis. Then you should take treatment accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health."
