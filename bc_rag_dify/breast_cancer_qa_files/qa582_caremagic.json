  "Q": "Im a breast cancer survivor who successfully survived a 3.9 cm tumor with surgery, chemo, and radiation in 2008. About a month ago, my husband was diagnosed with stage 3 throat cancer (they found evidence of disease in at least one lymph node). He has had both tonsils removed, and this is the second time he has had cancer. His first bout of throat cancer was in 2006, and an aggressive tonsilectomy was done, but that was all. No consult with an oncologist or anything. I guess my question is  is this a survivable condition, and I truly need an honest answer. My husband is 54 years old and otherwise very healthy.",
  "A": "Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. Treatment and survival depends on type and stage of throat cancer. He has previous history of cancer.  Now he has cancer with lymph node metastasis. He should go for surgery followed by chemotherapy and radiation treatment according to type and stage of cancer. Consult your oncologist and plan accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health."
