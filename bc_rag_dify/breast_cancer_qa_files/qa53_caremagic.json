  "Q": "I have been sick for about 2 weeks now.  It started out I was so drained.  Nasty cough.  Very cold.  then it went away.  Now the left side of my neck is swallon and hurts to touch.  white stuff lines the left side of my throat.  What could this be??  Should I go to a doctor",
  "A": "Thanks for your query at Chat Doctor! You seem to have acquired viral (RSV, Influenza, Para influenza, adenovirus, mumps, etc) or bacterial (Streptococcus Group B, Corynebacterium, Pneumococcus, etc) infection of respiratory tract. I suggest you get the complete mammogram and throat swab and blood culture tested for gram stain and culture sensitivity for aerobic/anaerobic bacteria. Get treated based on your tests. Viral infections are self-limiting, but you can start treatment to prevent secondary complications with bacterial infections. You can start analgesics, anti-inflammatory with serratiopeptidase, anti-allergic and antibiotics(azithromycin/erythromycin) which would require prescription from a local doctor. Do gargles with chlorhexidine wash for 6-8 times/day. Hope I was helpful. Take care! Take multimineral/multivitamins also"
