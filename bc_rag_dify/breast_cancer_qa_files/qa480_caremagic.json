  "A": "Hi, Thanks for writing in. Unfortunately your sister-in-law has stage 4 cancer. This is because the breast cancer is spread to the spine, pelvis and cervical spine which recently involves the lung and liver. Spread of breast cancer happens in a few patients and has an expected survival for 2 years with good care and treatment. She might be provided chemotherapy and radiation therapy to reduce the disease progression and extend her survival. Your sister-in-law might be having a lot of pain and reducing the pain and discomfort is important. For her pain please talk to her doctor and let her be at least discomfort. Her nutrition is also important and providing high energy foods with protein might help. Please do not worry."
