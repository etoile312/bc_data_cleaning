  "Q": "My grandma went to the hospital. she had a lump on her head. they found nodules in femur bone. femur bone deteriorating. inserted rod and did bone marrow to check for cancer. also found a lump on lung causing all of us to believe it could be from her breast cancer years ago and now its spreading. the tests on marrow came back today and no cancer there. what else could it be?",
  "A": "Hi! Good evening. I am Chat Doctor answering your query. If I were your doctor, I would go for a PET scan in this condition where biopsy came out to be negative. If need be I would go for a repeat biopsy from any other suitable site after a detailed clinical examination. I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your grandmas' problem. Please do not hesitate to ask in case of any further doubts. Thanks for choosing Chat Doctor to clear doubts on your health problems. I wish your grandma an early recovery. Chat Doctor."
