  "Q": "Hi, About ten years ago I had a biopsy on my breast. Praise the Lord it was fine. Today my breast has been stinging a bit around the scar. I cant feel anything but it is uncomfortable. I get really nervous because I have a friend going thru BC right now.",
  "A": "Hi, Thanks for writing in. Stinging and tingling around a scar is not a confirmatory sign of cancer. It surely raises a concern since you have had a biopsy in exactly the same region ten years back. Breast cancer awareness has increased over the years, and it is important to get a screening test done for your breast. It is most likely that you might not have any disease, but it is important to get a screening test done to confirm it. Please consult a cancer screening clinic near you and get a screening mammography and breast ultrasound done at the earliest. While a screening mammography picks up suspicious areas, the breast ultrasound will tell you about the area under the scar and if there is any concern or changes below the skin that might require more detailed investigation. You can also check for any lumps or lymph node swellings in your armpits and bring it to the notice of your doctor. Please do not worry."
