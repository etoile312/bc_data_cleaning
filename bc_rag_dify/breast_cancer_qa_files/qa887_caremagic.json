  "Q": "I had a crown to a jaw tooth about 7 years ago. the dentist said she may need to do root canal soon. i didnt get it done. Then I had stage 3 breast cancer , went through chemo. and radiation. Now I think the infection under the crown has spread to my neck lymph nodes and I have head aches. Is this something I need to see orthodonist or regular doctor for?",
  "A": "Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query. The tooth infection in a crowned tooth is resulting in pain in the head. The lymph node tenderness and enlargement. Nothing to be panic, consult an oral physician and get it evaluated. Meanwhile you can take a course of antibiotics like amoxicillin(if you are not allergic). Once the diagnosis is confirmed the tooth can be treated with root canal treatment. I hope my answer will help you, take care."
