  "Q": "Briefly, my mother, who is 81, has been diagnosed with bladder cancer in 2010. She was on Warfarin all this time, and recently, her physicians decided to stop the Warfarin completely. She was treated 3 times by a local urologist with the \"tuberculin\" remedy. The third time my mother went in to the office, she could not hold the liquid. My mother decided to stop everything and eat organic foodstuffs and try to heal herself with holistic remedies. Her last visit to her Urologist confermed that there were 2 more small tumors that have invaded the muscle tissue of the bladder.  Four days ago, she started passing very large blood clots. The blood clots have now stopped and so has the blood in her urine. Can you tell me, how advanced the cancer might be?",
  "A": "Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. She has bladder cancer. Blood in urine is quite common symptoms of bladder cancer. Warfarin should not be taken.  It will increase the bleeding.  She has involvement of muscle layer of bladder, so it is minimum stage 2 or more.  She should go for radical mastectomy followed by chemotherapy or radiotherapy according to need. Consult your doctor and take treatment accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health."
