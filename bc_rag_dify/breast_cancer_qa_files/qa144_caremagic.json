  "Q": "i found a lump in my left breat a year ago,I had a scan and they said it was just compressed fat cells,and not malignant.I recently noticed that the same breast that it itches inside, under the skin, and the shape and texture of the aureole has changed, and the skin has darkened.Should I be worried?Is this cancer? My sister was diagnosed with breats canbcer when she wa 26, she had 2 lumpectomy s and was on kimo, and has survived.She is 41 now, but i am always worried. Can you advise?",
  "A": "Hi.based from your description, it could possibly be a cyst, a fibrous (fibrous tissue formation) or fibrotic changes of the breast, which are all benign breast lesions. It is best if you consult with a doctor, preferably a general surgeon, for clinical evaluation. Diagnostics such as breast ultrasound and mammography may be recommended. Management (medical and/or surgical) will be directed accordingly. Hope this helps. Good day!!~ Chat Doctor. "
