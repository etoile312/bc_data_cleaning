  "Q": "HI , my name is Evi, I am 40, and I had a Hysterectomy a few years ago because of cancer, and I am on hormone pills.Last  month while working at my job, I was not looking where I was going and ran into the corner of a cardboard box , and bruised my left breast, it did not leave a mark. My left breast is still sore, and there is a kinda  hard place in my breast. I went this long with out having my breast looked at because I thought I would go away like all bruises.   I have told my husband about this and he looked up my symptoms online, and told me it might be what is called a deep tissue bruise or a breast contusion, that takes a long time to heal. This worries me alot, because it has not healed, and plus having cancer once. Could this type of bruise become cancer?This has me so worried.Hope you can help me . thanks",
  "A": "Hi ! Yes, it could be a deep tissue bruise which takes a longer time to heal. However, because you have a past history of cancer for which you had a Hysterectomy done, your concern is also justified. To have a proper piece of mind, I would suggest you to get yourself reviewed by a general surgeon, who may advise you for a mammogram. As such a screening mammogram in your case would be appropriate. Wishing you an early recovery."
