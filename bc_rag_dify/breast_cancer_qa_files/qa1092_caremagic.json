  "Q": "hi I am 38 yrs old 50kg,150cm. Recently I have diagnosed with lumps on my both breast and I did my ultrasound and mammogram which found to be negative.I want to know  whether I should go for  the surgery and remove the lump.I will send you the report now.",
  "A": "HI. Thanks for your query. If the mammography and ultrasonography are negative the tensions are reduced. As there are definite lumps, I would advise going for FNAC of all the lumps to rule out cancer. If the lumps are causing pain or any other symptoms, they can be removed to get rid of the lumps and to get the definitive diagnosis.Also, a clinical examination is very important to be done by a Surgeon to see the status of the maxillae and neck region. As a general rule, anything which is not a normal part of the body, should be removed and subjected to histology examination."
