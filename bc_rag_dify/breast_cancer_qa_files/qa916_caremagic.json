  "Q": "I and many other omen have a very rare breast cancer, it is not considered a breast cancer but it is on the breast. It is called Phyllodes. We have a group on line of women with this. I feel we need to let others in on this. I feel many women have been left just watching this tumor until it grow so large it must be removed. My case it was watched over five years doing nothing and then one day it grew and they did a lumpectomy only to discover they had to go back and do a mastectomy in order to get clear margins. This can spread to lungs and bones. I just want the women of the world to know and doctor also. Many doctors haven t heard of this or know how to treat it. We need your help to spread the word. Thank you",
  "A": "Hi I am Chat Doctor.  These followed are liposarcomas mostly glad it went will with both operations lumpectomy and the mastectomy and I am too sorry for that, thanks for your wonderful feelings. The lesion should not be \"shelled out,\" as might be done with a fibroadenoma, or the recurrence rate will be unacceptably high. Total mastectomy, with or without reconstruction maybe needed in some cases early diagnosis is the most effective way of protection a lot of chemo therapies, radiotherapies, immunoassays are developed but of minor or no rule with this specific tumor Hope the above information helps you, Thanks for writing into Chat Doctor. Any further clarifications feel free to ask"
