  "Q": "I am 50 years old and I felt some lump in my breast. My doctor advised me to take Evion 600 mg capsule one every day. Is there any side effect as I feel that after starting to take this capsule I have pain in my ankle and foot. Is it because of this medicine",
  "A": "Welcome to Chat Doctor .1. Since when you are feeling the lump and what symptoms its causing, weather examined by the doctor you have not mentioned.2. About the capsule - its just vitamins with negligible side effects, its could be opportunistic causing pain, if you still doubt - stop for a week and see.3. For breast lump - you need to visit your doctor and get an ultrasound scan done to find out what kind of the lump it is.4. As in your age any breast mass need to be evaluated and treated before it gets complicated5. Hope it helps. Anything to ask ? Do not hesitate. Thank you."
