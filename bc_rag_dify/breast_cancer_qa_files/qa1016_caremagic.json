  "Q": "My mom was diagnosed with stage IV colon cancer 6 years ago. She also has stage III breast cancer . Recent scan shows metastisis to her liver , lungs, kidney . They are all over 4mm in size. She has a spot on her left shoulder that is fluid pocket with tumors that move around. Could you please tell me how much time she might have left?",
  "A": "Welcome to ChatDoctorThanks for the query. I am sorry about your mom and her serious disease. These are very bad signs and prognosis is very poor. Statistically it is about 3-6 months. But of course it is not easy to predict, and it depends on from man to man. Also, if she receives any behemoth life may be prolonged for few months but generally if she lives 6 months it will be optimistic.  Wish you good health. Regards."
