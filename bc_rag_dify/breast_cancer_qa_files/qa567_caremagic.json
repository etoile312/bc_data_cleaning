  "Q": "In 1985, I developed a glomerulonephritis that was treated with corticosteroids. However, I was told that I should not be taking ASA. Yesterday, a report on ASA and cancer highlighted the advantages of aspirine in the prevention of cancer. Last year I was diagnosed with breast cancer , had a mastectomy of the right breast and took chemo and am now on targeted therapy. My question is can I be sure that my glomerulonephritis was due to aspirine intake? Also how true is it that Asprine prevents cancer and should I be taking it?",
  "A": "HI, thanks for using Chat Doctor The advice regarding not using aspirin was given because aspirin and medications similar to it can damage the kidneys. Glomerulonephritis was not caused by the aspirin, but aspirin can cause further damage. This would also go for medications such as ibuprofen, Catalan, Celebrex, naproxen and the other members of the NSAID family. Aspirin certainly is a useful Chat Doctor.  It has been linked to reducing cancer risks, but further studies are needed to confirm this. It would be best to continue avoiding it based on your history of kidney disease. I hope this helps"
