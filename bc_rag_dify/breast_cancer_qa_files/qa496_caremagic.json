  "Q": "I m a 63 y.o female, recently diagnosed with giant cell tumor on my thumb. I have a history of breast cancer 41/2 years ago, stage 1. The orthopedist says the GCT is benign but has only done X-rays. Can this be diagnosed accurately without a biopsy and can you describe recovery from this surgery? Best case scenario?e",
  "A": "Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. You have history of breast cancer. You have giant cell tumor on thumb.  So most probably it is giant cell tumor of tendon Seth. You should go for excision biopsy.  Wife excision is the treatment of choice for this tumor.  Consult your doctor and take treatment accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health."
