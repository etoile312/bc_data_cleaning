  "Q": "Hi Doctor, my wife has been going through breast cancer treatment and has been in a very critical state. We have 3 young children, and it s placed alot of stress on me. I am 46 yrs old male. Last Friday, I had rushed her to the hospital and then back to work, had only a protein bar for lunch with some coffee, then stood for 1.5 hrs and taught some folks at work. After 1.5 hrs, I suddenly felt very dizzy. I went and grabbed some Cliff bars (2), OJ, and a Gatorade. I excused my self, went to the car, felt a panic attack come on, and was take by ambulance to the ER. They performed radioisotope testing on my heart along with a stress test. All turned out normal, and I was sent home. My neck is still stiff and I still feel woozy. Any room for concern?",
