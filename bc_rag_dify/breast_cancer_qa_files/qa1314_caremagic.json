  "Q": "I had a diagnostic mammogram and underarm ultrasound for a noticable thickening under my right arm yesterday. Diagnosing doctor said it was just fatty tissue and no swollen lymph nodes and nothing on mammogram. Swelling as I call it started in April. Saw OB/GYN for yearly in May, she noticed it as well and wrote the scrip for ultrasound and mammo if symptom persisted. Now have pain under arm in that area, spread to both arms, upper back and other armpit. Also general feel like I m coming down with something in the past week or two. No idea where to go next.",
  "A": "Hi, thank-you for providing the brief history of you. As you have been ruled out for any lymph node issue after the mammogram I feel you should get a neurological examination done for the cervical spine. As I suspect your age to he more than 40 as you had mammogram, you may have some degenerative aging changes in the spine leading to pinching of nerve and an MRI of cervical spine should help further. Due to the nerve impingement there might be sensory disturbances in the course of the nerve and also the pain depending on the nerve fibers getting disturbed. Trying out physical therapy for the pain you have been facing should help you. As in my clinical practice most pains can be controlled and eliminated by physical therapy.regards Jay In Chat Doctor. "
