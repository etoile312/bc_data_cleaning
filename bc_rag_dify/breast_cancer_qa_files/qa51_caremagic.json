  "Q": "I am 57 yrs. old and get mammograms regularly,about 5 yrs ago my right nipple stopped protruding when stimulated and if squeezed white creamy smelly stuff came out,I told my dr. she said to just leave it alone,about a week ago it felt sore and when I looked it was prodruded out and in the middle of my nipple is a red sore hard bump?",
  "A": "Dear Ma'am, Sorry to hear about your problem. The symptoms which you are describing can be explained due to two conditions. One is known as duct Eurasia, and it commonly occurs around the time of menopause and can lead to the formation of abscesses (red, painful sum) close to the nipple associated with discharge. There is also a small possibility of it being cancer. My advice to you would be to visit your breast surgeon and have your condition evaluated. In addition, get a mammogram and a sonomammogram."
