  "A": "You're vomiting a large amount of blood as is clear from your description could mean one of 2 things, considering your smoking history. Either you have developed stomach ulcers which have now started bleeding. This is quite common in smokers. Or, you have developed stomach cancer which is now bleeding. This is also possible in long term smokers. What you need to do urgently is to see a gastroenterologist and get an endoscopy done through your mouth or nose. That will differentiate between the 2, locate the exact site of bleeding, and if required stop any active bleed. The chills, dizziness and weakness was due to sudden blood loss. You may need a blood transfusion also depending on your hemoglobin. Meanwhile, Chat Doctor. "
