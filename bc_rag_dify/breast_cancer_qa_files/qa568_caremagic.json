  "Q": "Hi, may I answer your health queries right now ?  Please type your query here...My right nipple started to invert and when I went to my gynocologist she squeezed the nipple and a clear fluid came out.  She did a nipple smear whicChatDoctore back negative, but she sent me to a breast surgeon anyway.  The breast surgeon sent me for an MRI whicChatDoctore back negative.  Now the surgeon wants to do a biopsy because she says the fluid is not normal.  My mother had breast cancer and my fraternal aunt died of breast cancer.  Am I doing the right thing by having the biopsy or not.",
  "A": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. Yes, biopsy is needed in your case. You are having strongly positive family history of breast cancer. You are also having inverted nipple with abnormal nipple discharge. All these can be early signs of breast cancer. So better to rule out early breast cancer in you by biopsy. And early breast cancer is having excellent prognosis with near normal life. So get done biopsy. Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health. Thanks."
