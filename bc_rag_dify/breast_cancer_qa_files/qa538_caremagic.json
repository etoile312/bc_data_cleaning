  "Q": "Hello, I am from XXXXXXX. I am 27 years old and a breast cancer patient-Stage II. had surgery in February 2012, now taking chemotherapy . 1st 4 chemo has completed and now taking texotere medicine as a result my SGPT becoming high after taking texotere. I started to taxotere (60mg each week of total 12 weeks) on 5th june and then SGPT was 89.. afetr 3 weeks while it came 60 i took 2nd doz on 24th june and then had test for sgpt which result was 130. yesterday i did test again and result is 390. I am really tensed about this. For increasing SGPT i am not being able to taking chemo weekly. Is it very harmful for my treatment? FYI i am doing service, My doctor told me to take bed rest. please suggest me How can i reduce it. can i get a food chart ( what i cant eat) Thanks & Regards",
  "A": "Hi It appears that the high level of SGPT is due to texture. With this level (>5 times of upper limit), you have to stop texture for time being and wait for it to come down. After that you may try its alternative, Taxon and see what happens. By the way, the better way to give texture is to give it 3 weekly (dose is higher), while Taxon is usually given weekly. You can discuss this with your oncologist. You can continue your normal diet."
