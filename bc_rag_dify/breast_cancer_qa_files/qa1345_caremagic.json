  "Q": "i had sex one week before my periods and took ipill within half an hour. what are chances that i am pregnant?",
  "A": "Welcome to Chat Doctor I-pill is effective in preventing pregnancy if taken within 72 hours. You will have good chance of not being pregnant. There will be some menstrual disturbance in a few days like spotting, heavy flow, irregular cycle, but they will become normal in 2-3 cycles. Also avoid taking Emergency contraceptive pill frequently like a normal contraceptive because it has the lot of side effects like weight gain, breast tenderness, nausea, abdominal pain. Use condom which will prevent against STDs also."
