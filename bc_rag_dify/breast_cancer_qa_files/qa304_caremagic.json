  "Q": "My wife was diagnosed with breast cancer two years ago and we got the surgery done and also done chemotherapy and radiation and we were of the opion that everything is taken care but now we realised that there is a lump on her neck after which we got biopsy done and we came to know that it has become metastasis and that our doctor who was treating her told us that we have mere 6 - 9 moths in our hand and that the only treatment on it is to take another sessions of chemotherapy but it is not gauranteed that it will be cured. My question to you is that can my wife be treated in Dr. Balaji`s clinic and what would be the line of treament. Please revert us as early as possible.",
  "A": "Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. She has history of breast cancer.  She was treated with surgery followed by chemotherapy and radiotherapy.  Now she has lymph node metastasis.  Treatment depends on spread.  She should go for ct scan and PET scan.  First check the whole body for any other metastatic lesion.  Then start treatment accordingly. Chemotherapy is needed.  Dosage and schedule depends on spread.  Consult your doctor and take treatment accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health."
