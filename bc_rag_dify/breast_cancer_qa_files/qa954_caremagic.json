  "Q": "I have an abnormal right axillary lymph node - found in a breast scan June 2013. I had the scan due to extreme density. I m 48, over 4 years post-menopausal. The 25 mm in length lymph node had a 5 mm corticol thickening. The biopsy revealed a no cancer, but a lymph node that must have remained enlarged after some sort of infection my body had. (although I ve had none prior to this finding) I now have pain under my arm, specifically in that area where the enlarged lymph node is. I also have pain directly under my nipple. Is all this precursors for cancer?",
  "A": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. In my opinion you are having inflammatory cause for enlarged lymph nodes in maxilla. As your biopsy from breast mass is negative for cancer, I don't think lymph nodes are malignant in nature. Znother evidence is pain in the lymph nodes. Pain usually seen in infection, inflammatory nodes and not in malignant nodes. So chances of malignant nodes are very less but still I advise to get done biopsy and confirm the diagnosis."
