  "Q": "sure, i took my mom to a hospital on the 19th of december, they discover she had cancer through out her body, she died at home 6 days later. She had always been seen at another hospital, and had numerous scans and blood tests everything you could imagine, but failed to find cancer that had been spread through her body for 9-12 months, well, now that i have vented, could someone with chf and copd under go masectamy and chemo? and how could a hospital miss it, out of lots of cts and bone scans and xrays and mamograms ect, also how can i find a doctor to review the case for merit, the cancer doc at the other hospital said the hospital simply missed the cancer. but docs that close to another hospital probally wont stand up in court and say that",
  "A": "Hi, Many a time it is very difficult to diagnose a primary cancer. From your question it can be said that she had metastatic disease to start with but what made you think mastectomy and chemo may be a treatment option is not clear to me, anyway CHF and COPD are relative contraindications for a major surgery even these can be tried in special circumstances. As you have mentioned your mom was on regular follow up at a hospital and lots of CTs, Bone scan X-rays Ammo were done, probably her breast cancer screening was done regularly. There are many cancers which are not picked up by screening and with a very short period present with a metastatic disease. However, this is a depressing fact that your doctors failed to help you so much."
