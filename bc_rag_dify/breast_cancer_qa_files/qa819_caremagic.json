  "Q": "Hi, may I answer your health queries right now ?  Please type your query here...My left nostril has been blocked for about 6-7 weeks now, and my neck gland is beginning to ache.  I have had breast cancer and am on letrozole, and am scared I may have nasal cancer.  I have suffered from sinus all my life, but strangely did not have any symptoms while I was on chemo.",
  "A": "Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. You have history of breast cancer. But your block nostril is not due to cancer most likely.  It very uncommon that breast cancer metastasis is nostril.  You may have sinusitis.  You should go for ct scan. Anti histamines like chlorpheneremine palate or cetirizine is helpful. Consult your doctor and take treatment accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health."
