  "Q": "I am recovering from breast cancer where I had a bilateral mastectomy and many lymph nodes removed. I have been on tamoxifen for 6 months now. i have been gaining weight in leaps and bounds. i am back to my weekly exercise routine and the pounds are still piling on. my worry is the tremendous bloating around my stomach. It stays bloated and swelled. Could this be something else besides just weight gain?",
  "A": "Tamoxifen does not cause weight gain. If you are premenopausal or postmenopausal It may be the reason. If you received chemotherapy your ovarian function will be effected leading to weight gain. Normal ovarian function will be back within a year after chemotherapy. Fluid retention and edema can also lead to weight gain. Exercise and avoid concentrated sugar food or fluid. Diet containing moderate fiber also helps."
