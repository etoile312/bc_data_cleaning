  "Q": "Hi, i have had some dull chest pain on my left side. I become aware of the pain when a carry one of my children, i have a 3 year old an 7month old twins. I feel the dull pain on the left side of my chest/breast area. It feels to be under the breast area. No lumps . Could this be something serious? such as breast cancer . I have had an ultrasound performed on my left breast and, thankfully nothing was found however the dull pain remains. Would a mammogram rule out any possibility of cancer?",
  "A": "Hello dearmastalgia (breast pain) without lump is unlikely related to cancer. Hence need not worry. Mastalgia are of two type 1)CYCLICAL: starts one or two days prior to menstruation and relieves on onset of menstruation 2)NON-CYCLICAL: is not related to menstrual cycle. Cyclical needs only counselling, evening primrose 3gm/day in divided doses, avoid coffee and chocolate intake. Noncyclical needs only painkiller. Hence classify your pain into cyclical and noncyclical. And take decision. Hope this is helpful to you."
