  "Q": "Hi, I found a breast lump and was referred to a clinic which Im now waiting for an appointment! I feel very anxious as everything about breast cancer says the earlier detected the better chance of survival. Clinic told me today I could have to wait 6 weeks",
  "A": "Hi, Thanks for writing to Chat Doctor. The main factor here is your age. If your age is less than 35yrs then less likely to have cancer. Other features which suggest lump could be a cancer are -rapid growth of lump-skin over lump is puckered or fixed -hard and fixed lump-nipple abnormalities-bleeding from nipple -family history of breast cancer -small swellings in corresponding arm pit. I would suggest you to seek medical attention soon if any of the above feature you have. You can get FNAC done. This is aspiration from lump and its study. It is minor procedure just like giving injection. You can wait if your lump is freely mobile in breast, and it is not hard and slow growing. I suggest you better get FNAC done instead of only relying on of signs. Any pathologist will do FNAC. Hope I have been helpful. Regards Chat Doctor. "
