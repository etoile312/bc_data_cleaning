  "A": "Hi, Thanks for writing in. Stage 4 cancer usually has a survival for 2 years with good treatment and supportive care. Every cancer patient responds differently to treatment and your mother might require an aggressive treatment to control disease progression. The primary goal of treatment in stage 4 cancer is to provide extension of survival and reduce pain and discomfort. Survival is extended by giving medicines that stabilize the disease process and cause and slow down the disease progress rate. This might be achieved by giving a combination of medicines including repeat endocrine therapy to which she has responded in the past. Please do not worry."
