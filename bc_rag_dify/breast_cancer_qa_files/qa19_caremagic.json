  "Q": "Hi I noticed a lump bigger in my right breast than in my left, but I do not know what kind of lump is bad. I am 18 and I know it is very rare for it to mean anything but I have been feeling very sick lately. Sick to my stomach and my neck, back, and all of my joints have been hurting very very bad for the past few days. I have been getting headaches through out the day, and I do not know what is causing this. There is no way I could be pregnant.",
  "A": "Hi.it is best if you consult with a physician, preferably a general or a breast surgeon, for clinical evaluation. Benign breast lesions (such as cysts and fibrotic changes) usually occur when there are hormonal changes (i.e. before during menses, pregnancy, etc.). Breast ultrasound may be initially recommended. If lesions are found, diagnostics and management (medical and/or surgical) will be directed accordingly. Hope this helps. Good day!!~ Chat Doctor. "
