  "Q": "Dear Doctor, my 74 year old lady friend had a ct scan of the brain due to left sided weakness and falls post mastectomy.  Her report reads that there is marked background  atrophy with a single calcified granuloma seen in the left parietal region.  What does this mean?  Please Advice?",
  "A": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. With age organs of the body start regression in size and function. And this is also true with brain. Marked background atrophy means brain tissue is less functioning and reduced in size. This is age related process and this is normal. No need to worry about this. She is also having calcified granuloma. This is suggestive of old lesion. Calcification denotes healed, old lesion. So no need to worry about calcified granuloma also. Her symptoms are mostly due to age related brain changes. Hope I have solved your query. Wishing her good health. Thanks."
