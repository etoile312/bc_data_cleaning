  "Q": "Hi, I am a 32 year old female. I was recently diagnosed with a complex ovarian cyst. After that I continued regular check ups and it has been noted that my immature granulocytes have been elevated to around 5. My family has a strong history of breast cancer, mom is going through chemo for uterine cancer at this time. Are there any connections to these thing or what could the elevated count be? Thanks.",
  "A": "Hi, dear. I have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. You have immature granulocytes it may be due to some severe infection. However, you have strong family history of breast cancer and urine cancer. So you have also high chance of developing cancer.  You should go for regular screening for that.
