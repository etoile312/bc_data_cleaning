  "A": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. Chemotherapy Chat Doctor.  And due to this there is gaseous distention of stomach which gives feeling of bloating. Another possibility is intestinal obstruction.  Due to this the food and gas does not pass further and produce bloating sensation in upper abdomen. So get done ultrasound examination of abdomen to rule out obstruction. If obstruction is not present then gastritis is the cause. Better to start proton pump inhibitor. Avoid stress and anxiety. Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals. Go for walk after meals. Avoid hot and spicy food."
