  "A": "Hi, thanks for using Chat Doctor The cost of breast enhancement can vary. It would depend on the breast implant cost, where you are located, surgeon fees and other surgery related costs like anesthesia. The cost of the implant can range between 3000 and 4000 thousand dollars, US. Your doctor may be able to refer you to a center. It is important to remember that femininity is based on more than breast size. I hope this helps"
