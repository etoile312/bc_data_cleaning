  "Q": "Hello, I have been on nexplanon since July this year. It has been great really, I haven t had a period since I had it put in. In the past few days, however, I ve been having lower left abdominal and pelvic discomfort. Sometimes it feels like period cramps but I don t ever get a period. I m just wondering if this is something i should be worried about and what it could be? Also, i haven t taken a pregnancy test yet but I don t think I m pregnant because i don t have any other symptoms. I m not nausous, no breast tenderness, no change in smell, ect.",
