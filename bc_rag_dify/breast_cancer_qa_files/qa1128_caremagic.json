  "A": "Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum.  As you describe it appears to be the Desmond cyst, or a lymph gland due to some infection in the surrounding area.  I advise you to consult a surgeon for diagnosis and treatment.  You may need to have an excision or incision for complete cure.  I usually prescribe to my patient with such symptoms ofloxacin, ornidazole, serratiopeptidase, and diclofenac.  Wishing for a quick and complete recovery. Thank you."
