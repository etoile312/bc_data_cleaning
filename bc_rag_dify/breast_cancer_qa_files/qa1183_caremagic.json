  "Q": "I went to have my 11th year check up after a mastectomy . My mammograms have always been negative after my surgery. Yesterday my oncologist said that everything looked good that I did not come to see him anymore. Just to keep my yearly check up and my annual surgeon s visit. Well, today U received a call that I have a slight high TLC count and to stop taking my calcium meds for a two weeks period so I can get checked again. The funny thing is that I hardly ever take calcium. This month I might ve taken it 4 or 5 times. I am so scared. Now, everything that has been ailing me , I am connecting it to cancer. My shoulder blades, breathing problems and so on. Can you explain to me what else besides cancer may bring your tlc levels up?",
  "A": "Hi Death and welcome to Chat Doctor ....dear there a number of causes in which TLC count get raises ....most important one is bacterial infection anywhere in the body ....the purpose is to limit the infection ....some examples are:-throat infection, chest infection, dental infection, otitis media, urinary tract infection, abscess anywhere in the body, boils, cellulitis, rheumatic illnesses ...and so on .....so nothing to be worry about....wish you good health ....."
