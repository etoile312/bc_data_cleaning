  "Q": "While taking these birth control pills, Lo Loestrin Fe tab 1000-10-  , i been taking them since the end of October and I havent had a regular period.  I spotted with brown spots on December 27 and 28th then no more.  My breast have been tender and sore for the last 3 weeks.  Should I be concerned?  What to do?  My breast really hurts everyday.",
  "A": "HI, thanks for using Chat Doctor Contraceptives can be associated with breast tenderness and is probably the cause of this symptom. They also cause decreased menstrual flow but would normally regularize a women period. If the side effects of this particular pill are not tolerable, then you may want to consider asking your doctor to switch you to another tablet that you would be able to use with minimal problems. I hope this helps"
