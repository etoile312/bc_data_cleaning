  "Q": "I m 32 years of age, and over the past 2 months I ve had a lump develope under my left nipple. The lump isn t noticeable to the eye, but to the touch. It s not always painful but more discomfort. Should this be treated or will it eventually go away on its own?",
  "A": "Hi ! Good evening. I am Chat Doctor answering your query. If I were your doctor, without wasting time, I would refer you to a general surgeon for a clinical examination, possibly a mammogram and a core/excisional biopsy. Further management would depend on the results of a clinical examination of your breasts, maxilla, and reports of the investigations. I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem. Please do not hesitate to ask in case of any further doubts. Thanks for choosing Chat Doctor to clear doubts on your health problems. Wishing you an early recovery. Chat Doctor."
