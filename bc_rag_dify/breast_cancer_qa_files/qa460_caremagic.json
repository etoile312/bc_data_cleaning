  "Q": "Okay, well my name is Logan and I just found out today after football practice that my mom has breast cancer. Im terribly worried for her and have no idea what to do. How much of a chance is there for my mom to live? I dont know what I would do if she passed away! Please tell me everything about breast cancer so I can kind of know whats going on! Thank you!",
  "A": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your situation and problem. First no need to worry much for your mother. Breast cancer if detected early is having excellent prognosis and near normal future life. First consult oncologist and determine the stage of her breast cancer. For this she needs PET scan. There are four stages of breast cancer. Stage 1 and 2 needs surgery (mastectomy) and post-operative chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Stage 3-4 needs chemotherapy and radiotherapy with subsequent debunking surgery. So treatment options are many in breast cancer but first determine the stage of cancer. Consult oncologist and discuss all these. Hope I have solved your query. Wishing good health to your mother. Thanks."
