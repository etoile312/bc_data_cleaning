  "Q": "Hi Dr., My aunt is in the hospital right now because cancer is pretty much suffocating her. She started out having it only in her breasts now she has it pretty much around most of her body (recently found in her stomach ). However, oddly enough she wasn t admitted because of her cancer, it was because she had fluid in her lungs. Did this happen because of cancer? The doctors are saying she is in horrible condition and may not even last long....",

The prognosis for your aunt does not look that good at the moment, and you should make sure that you guys provide her full support. Hope this helped. Regards"
