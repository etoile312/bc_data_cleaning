  "Q": "Hi my name is kathleen , and I had breast cancer in 2009 and had the right breast removed.. Then in 2012 the cancer returned. Went through chemo and radiation for a short time. Went back and had an ultrasound done last week and was told that they couldn t find any thing. But I have a thickness and its hurts only when I touch it. Should I be worried?",
  "A": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. In my opinion no need to worry much for hard feeling of breast tissue because your ultrasound examination is native. This because of radiotherapy you had received. Radiotherapy damages surrounding fat tissue and overlying skin too. So due to this fibrous healing occurs in fat tissue and this gives hard feeling. Overlying skin also becomes rough. So no need to worry much as these are routine side effects of radiotherapy."
