  "Q": "hello my wife in her inner left breast towards the center of her chest she ha s small soft lump that hurts when you touch it. also, it hurts when she breathes in. she is 26, 115 pounds and relatively healthy. it is a pain that comes on an off. we are worried but also wondering if it has to do with her cycle. always seems to come a few days before her period...",
  "A": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your wives situation and problem. By your history and description, in my opinion, she is having benign breast lump due to hormonal imbalance during menstruation. Her breast lump and its association with periods is suggestive of hormonal lump only. So better to consult gynecologist and get done hormone levels to rule out hormonal imbalance. Hormone therapy is very effective in such cases. Also get done mammography to rule out other causes of breast lump like fibroadenoma or infection. Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health. Thanks."
