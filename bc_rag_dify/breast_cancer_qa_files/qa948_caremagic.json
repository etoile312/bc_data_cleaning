  "A": "Hi, Dear thanks for the query to Chat Doctor. I went through details of your query and understood the health concerns you had.It's a complex issue for you, as you are a breast cancer patient with remissions for 3 yrs now. And this lump is worrying you as you missed out Orly check up for the breast. Causes for the soft lump at base of the neck-In my opinion I would need more info as to ?size ? Mobility with swallowing? Is it on only one side or both sides. Still empirically -It could be Thyroid swelling -and USG / and USG guided FNAC would fix the diagnosis, as you are worried about it to be Cancer or not. Hope this would solve your query. Wellcome for any further query in this regard. Wish you fast recovery. Have A Good Day. With Regards"
