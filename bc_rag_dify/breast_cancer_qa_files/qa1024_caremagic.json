  "A": "Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. You have fibrotic disease of breast. If you have any lump in your breast then you should go for fine needle aspiration cytology or biopsy of that lump.  It can be cancer.  Fire cystic disease can turn out in cancer. So rule out the chance of malignancy first.  Then if needed you can take tamoxifen accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health."
