  "A": "Hi! Venu, I understand your need and dilemma. Lasers are costly and then in Becker the results are variable too. You are right in your way. I think to be doubly sure, you can get a skin biopsy done and then go ahead with the tattoo. As such, tattoo should not cause cancer. But your tattoo artist should be experienced too. By the way, where do you belong to. Wish you good health, regards, Chat Doctor. "
