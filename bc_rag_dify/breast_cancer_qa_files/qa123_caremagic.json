  "Q": "I have slightly raised white patches on my hard palate, which appear to end just before the soft palate. I just noticed it this evening. I have also been very fatigued for several weeks, and have had a yellow vaginal discharge for about the same amount of time. It has been slightly over a year since I had my last chemotherapy treatment for breast cancer.",
  "A": "Hello and welcome to Chat Doctor, A white patch anywhere in the oral mucosa can occur due to a number of causes. For all practical purposes a white patch in oral mucosa is called leukoplakia. The cause for such a patch needs to be found out. Fungal infection, lichen plans, even a hyperplasia, sub mucosal hyperplasia, cancer can lead to white patch in the oral mucosa. A clinical examination and biopsy of the affected region is required to make a correct diagnosis. There is a possibility of fungal infection as chemotherapy suppresses the immunity of the person to an extent. However, exact diagnosis can be made only after relevant investigations. Management depends on the underlying cause of the lesion. Yellow colored vaginal discharge suggests an infection of the genital tract. Various microorganisms can cause yellow colored discharge e.g. bacterial vaginosis, trachomas infection, fungal infection, etc. An examination of the vaginal discharge needs to be done. Consult your gynecologist for clinical examination and investigations. None of these symptoms suggest a recurrence of breast carcinoma. Thanks and take care Chat Doctor. "
