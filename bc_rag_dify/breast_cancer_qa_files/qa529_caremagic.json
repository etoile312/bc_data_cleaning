  "Q": "False pregnancy i suppose. Hi my name is Brittany im 18 years old. My boyfriend and i have recently become sexually active. Im on the shot and we have had some cases where he has not worn a condom. It always leads me to believe i could be pregnant, although all the tests are negative. I seem to have some of the symptoms of a pregnancy but never am actually pregnant. Some of these symptoms are- throwing up, fatigue, excessive weight gain and breast tenderness. All these show up pretty fast. Do you know why? Also after sex the next day i get a major stomach ache usually on my bottom left i believe. It sometimes lasts for days I also have no idea why this happens.  Thank you for taking the time to read this and help me out.",
  "A": "Hi. Yes this may be Pseudocyesis : Means there is no actual pregnancy, but the patient gets all the signs and symptoms. This is confirmed by a negative ultrasonography. He is patient who has the extreme desire of having Motherhood again develops this sort of problem. No one really knows the reason and the exact mechanism by which this happens. Consult your Senior Gynecologist who has seen such more cases for counselling and further management. The pain in the bottom left can be due to IBS / Colitis or a problem with your tube and / or ovary; ultrasonography will help get a proper diagnosis. And your Gynecologist will be helping you in this regard too."
