  "A": "Hello, Thanks for trusting us with your health concern. I have gone through your query and here are the answers. Firstly, any unprotected intercourse during the safe period does not cause conception. Ovulation occurs two weeks prior to the onset of the next period and this is the fertile period in the cycle. So, if you happened to have the intercourse during the safe period, you are naturally protected. The intake of the emergency pill occurred during the stipulated time after the intercourse, so the protection offered is in the range of 98%. The pill can cause side effects like nausea, headaches, vomiting, breast tenderness and with Chat Doctor.  The next natural period also may get delayed by a week or two. Please restrict the use of the pill to one or two occasions per year and get further help if you become overdue by ten days for your next period. Hope this helps."
