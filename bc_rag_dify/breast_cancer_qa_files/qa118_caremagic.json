  "Q": "I have been diagnosed with early stage invasive ductile carcinoma and invasive lobular carcinoma. All lymph nodes clear except for two lymph nodes in my breast under the lobular carcinoma. I have had a bi- lateral mastectomy and 23 lymph nodes from my left side. Tutors on the left breast. Right breast clear. What post operative treatment is recommended? Positive for estrogen and progesterone.",
  "A": "Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. You have invasive ductal and lobular carcinoma.  You should take chemotherapy according to stage.  Your estrogen and progesterone receptor is positive. You should take treatment against them.  Consult your doctor and take treatment accordingly.
