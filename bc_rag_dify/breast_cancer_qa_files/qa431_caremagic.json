  "Q": "I am a 54 year old female. I have a fracture in my 10th rib caused by an adjustment at my chiro visit. I was lying on my stomach, the middle part of my back was adjusted by pushing down. I have noticed swelling to my left breast. Is this normal? I do have breast implants. Thank you, Tammie",
  "A": "Welcome to Chat Doctor I have gone through your query and understand your concern. It may be that left breast also got injury when you got injury to ribs. Treatment of it is rest and analgesic such as ibuprofen. You need to visit physician for clinical examination. You can discuss with your treating Doctor about it. Hope I have answered your query. If you have any further questions then don't hesitate to writing to us. I will be happy to help you. Wishing you good health. Take care."
