  "Q": "Went to my doc, showed her two lumps under my left collar bone. She said they were not to worry about, swollen lymph nodes but to let her know if they for bigger. 6 weeks later I called her as they had almost doubled in size. I had also found more lumps. I went back, all of my infraclavicular lymph nodes are enlarged. She sent me to a surgeon, he says it is just a sebaceous cyst and nothing to worry about? My primary doc is sendin me for a second opinion and for a mammogram. I am not sure what to think, or who I should believe.",
  "A": "Hello, I can understand your concern. The swellings that do not hurt or cause other symptoms may be cysts and uninfected cysts do not hurt. They are left where they are without any treatment as they are not harmful to health. If they get infected in future and cause pain and discomfort, then surgical removal of those cysts can be decided as permanent solution. The primary doctor is just ruling out any chance of cancer by sending you for mammogram as breast cancer can sometimes cause painless swelling of supraclavicular lymph nodes. If the mammogram come negative, then he will agree with other doctors. So the steps you and the doctor have been following are correct and wait until appointment of the second doctor and mammogram. I hope this information helps. Thank you for choosing Chat Doctor. Take care. Best,"
