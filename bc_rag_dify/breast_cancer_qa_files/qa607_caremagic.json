  "Q": "I have a round firm lump behind my aerola slightly to the right of the aerola.  It is quite movable.  Im very worried!  I did have a cyst at the 12 oclock position which showed up on an ultrasound last year.  This cyst was 2.4cm now this lump is at 9 oclock and I cant feel the cyst (I was never able to feel the cyst).  Can cysts shift positions as they become harder and bigger?",
  "A": "Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. You have cyst and breast lump.  You may have fibroadenoma, fibrotic disease or breast cancer. Furthermore, you should go for mammography and biopsy of that lump. It will give you exact diagnosis. Then you should take treatment according to diagnosis. Consult your doctor and plan accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health."
