  "Q": "I am 33 years of age and I undergone through CABG in dec 2012. Earlier I used to smoke and my diet was not at all balanced. Not after the surgery I regularly go for a walk of 4 kms in the morning, take my medicines regularly, follow balanced diet but miss sometimes :). I have quit smoking but I use to take onle beer around 650ml that is too alternate day. I want to know that how many years I can live with the same life style. Is it true that CABG can give around 10 years of life span and after that the problem reoccur??",
  "A": "Hello. Thank you for your question and welcome to Chat Doctor. I understand your concern. That is true. About re-occurrence nothing could be told, but it is true that there are certain probabilities for bypasses to close. The probability for a saphenous vein graft, used for bypass, to be found close is 50% after ten years. Whereas, for the arterial grafts (left or right internal mammary arteries) is around 8-15%, depending on various studies. Anyway, I do not think that these figures should worry you. The most important thing is that the surgery went well, and you can live a normal and healthy life now. Even if the re-occurrence happens, there are other alternatives to treat the coronary arteries, such as stent implantation into a certain native coronary artery, bypass of which can be found narrowed or closed. As long as you are free of symptoms, there is nothing to worry about, however 6-monthly controls should be done. There are heralding symptoms, such as angina or shortness of breath, that speak for a narrowing or a new blockage within a graft vessel. In that case, coronary angiogram to control the native arteries and the patency of the grafts should be performed, and a strategy for treating new eventual blockages should be constructed. I hope this is helpful. Best regards, "
