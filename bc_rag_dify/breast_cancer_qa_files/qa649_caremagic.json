My breast have been very tender and I had surgery a couple months ago and had a non cancerous lump removed and now have another one back in the same place. Im 42 years old and had a hysterectomy when I was 28. I have one ovary left.",
  "A": "Welcome to Chat Doctor. 1. The symptoms suggest suspicious lump in the breast and enlarged lymph nodes in the axillary region.2. You have previously excised the lump, but possibly recurrence can be suspected with enlarged lymph nodes.3. Get a repeat ultrasound scan with guided FNAC - fine needle aspiration cytology of both breast lump and lymph node.4. Depending on the findings of mammogram, ultrasound and FNAC.5.
