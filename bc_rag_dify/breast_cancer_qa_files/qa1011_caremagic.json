  "Q": "M o m (58)Diagnosed with low sodium count below 124 ..loss of consciousness..memory unclear...urinary tract infection. History of brain metastatis with primary breast cancer...undergone chemotherapy and wbr and two cyberknife procedures Last 10 days nausea and weakness in body ...unable to walk...slurry speech...followed by loss of consciousness yesterday and in intensive care now",
  "A": "Hello! I understand your concern about your mother health! In my opinion this may be something more serious than just hypokalemia or the urinary infection. The symptoms you describe may be related to a brain lesion. The most probable diagnosed would be a new cancer metastasis in the brain. Breast cancer is known to give metastasis to the brain or bones even after many years after treatment. If she was my patient I would first perform a brain CT, followed by an MRI which is more sensible for these lesions. A blood routine test should be done to. Hope to have been helpful! Best wishes Chat Doctor.  AAZ Qua"
