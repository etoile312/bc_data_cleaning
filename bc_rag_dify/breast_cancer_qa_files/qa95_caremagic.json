  "Q": "A friend of mine has after 1 1/2 yr has now been diagnoised with breast cancer in her lung.  She had breast cancer back in 2011 and had chemotherapy for it at the time.  She is now back on chemo and has had just two sessions to date.  on Weds she met with her oncologist who said her cancer was aggressive.  Needless to say this is very worrrying for her.  What are her chances of surviving this?",
  "A": "Thanks for posting on ChatDoctorI presume that your friend had initially been diagnosed with breast cancer & now the lung cancer is possibly a secondary. Chances of survival is a very difficult question to answer as it all depends on what type of primary breast cancer it was at the time of diagnosis - also depends on how she responded to chemo at the time. If the lung cancer is secondary from breast & is aggressive - it will still depend on how she responds to chemo +/- radiotherapy. I wish all the best to your friend thanks"
