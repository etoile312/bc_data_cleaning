  "Q": "Hi. Two days after my cycle, we had sex and he pulled out before ejaculation when he realized the condom had broke. I took Plan B within 18 hours. I am not on birth control. I have been pregnant before. I had cramping after 4 days of taking the pill and then bled for 2 days. Today, I  noticed clear watery discharge from both nipple when breasts are squeezed. No nipple or breats tenderness. How likely is it that Im pregnant? My cycle shouldnt start for another 3 weeks.",
  "A": "HI, Thanks for your query.  I understand your concern.  * Reading your query I feel you have the least chance of conception because- -You had the sex in safe zone of your menses. (day 8 to 20 are supposed to be fertile period) _ though the condom was broken, you have taken plan B in 18 hours of sex. Plan B is successful in avoiding pregnancy when taken within 72 hours of unprotected sex. So if at all there is slight chance, it will be taken care of by Plan B. *Bleeding & cramping after 4 days of taking pills is due to with Chat Doctor. Your routine period may be delayed by one week, * breast tenderness is seen due to side effect of the hormone inbuilt in plan B. Clear discharge from nipples after squeezing can be seen after pills.  Thanks."
