  "A": "Hello dairy understand your concernSuccess rate of the pregnancy is around 85-90% as you took after 30 hours of the sex. Now you have to wait for the period come. Unwanted 72 also cause delayed/early and excessive bleeding. If your period will delay by the more than 10 days then go for urine pregnancy test and or blood Chat Doctor to rule out the pregnancy. If you will be pregnant then still you can terminate the pregnancy by abortion pill under the advice of the gynecologist. Breast pain and abdominal pain could be due to the side effect of the pill.
