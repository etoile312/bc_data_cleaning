  "Q": "I had botox treatments done on my armpits for excessive sweating about 17 months ago. Since then I get these sore lumps in my armpits that come and go. I ve been to my family physician twice to be sure it s not breast cancer . Both times she s told me they are on the surface, to put a warm cloth on them and if they don t go away come back for antibiotics for a possible infection. Can anyone shed some light on this. What is causing it? Was it related to the Botox treatments? Why was this not told to me as possible side effect? Dose stress cause them to flair up? How many years can I expect this to be an issue? Even though my doctor has examined me twice I m thinking of seeking a second opinion and perhaps a mamaogram to ensure these lumps aren t something more serious or hiding another more serious lump.",
  "A": "The symptoms that you are getting now are one of the side effects of Botox therapy and the same should have been told to you at the time of Botox treatment. Your family physician has advised you rightly regarding the treatment of this problem. It is a self limiting problem and generally subsides by now. In some patients it may last for years. They have no relation to stress. In order to rule out an associated problem, it is advisable for you to undergo a bilateral mammogram or ultrasound (if you are less than 30 years)"
