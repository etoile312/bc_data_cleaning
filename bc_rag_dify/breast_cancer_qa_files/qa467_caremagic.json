  "Q": "Hi I finished chemo for breast cancer about 2 and a half months ago, i have been experiencing discomfort but not pain in my abdomen on my right side. I told the doc and she ran an ultrasound (second one) and nothing was found. the discomfort comes and goes and worries me",
  "A": "Hi ! Good afternoon. I am Chat Doctor answering your query. Based on the history narrated by you and negative results of the repeat ultrasound, a CT or MRI abdomen could be thought of in case your discomfort persists. However, this decision could rightly be taken by your treating doctor, who knows your problem better than any of the doctors online. So consult your treating doctor with this feed back. Good luck. Please do not hesitate to ask in case of any further doubts. Thanks for choosing Chat Doctor to clear doubts on your health problems. Wishing you an early relief. Chat Doctor."
