  "Q": "I have had chemotherapy and Radiotherapy for breast cancer and completed the Radiotherapy just before christmas and since then have had blocked ears. My doctor had my ears syringed twice and gave me a nasal spray which I used for two weeks but my ears are still blocked and now my right ear seems to have fluid in it. Please help me doctor. Carmen",
  "A": "Hi, It is important to know what chemotherapy was given to you and also the pathological diagnosis of the cancer you have suffered from. Anyway, as you mention breast cancer probably it is infiltrating duct cancer as this is the common diagnosis. It is not clear from your question whether any surgery was done or not, are you put on any hormonal therapy or not. These issues will be dealt by your consultant oncologist. Your present problem is repeated blockage of right ear and feeling of presence of fluid in it. This complaint is not related to your malignant disease process. It may be due to secretory Otis media. Middle ear inflation with or without antibiotics may be an option. Consult with your otorhinolaryngologist.  Take care."
