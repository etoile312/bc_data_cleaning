  "Q": "I had swelling under my armpit a few weeks ago, the swelling has gone down but there is a lump, feels soft around the edges with a pea shaped hard lump in centre. I am 53 years old with a family history of breast cancer. Have had a few biopsies in the past years and all have come back clear. Have very dense breasts also. Having an ultrasound diagnostic mammogram in a few weeks. Should I be overly concerned",
  "A": "HI, Thanks for the query to Chat Doctor. Treatment for painful lump in armpit-A pea sized lump with dense breast should not worry you much. In my opinion, as the swelling has gone down lately, this lump is mostly-Boil in the armpit. Treatment is needed only if it grows in size again, as its dormant now and harmless to you. Consult a surgeon when it grows, and he would treat it accordingly with antibiotics. As you are going for mammography soon, it would resolve this lump issue also. Hope this would help you to plan treatment with mammography and ER doctor. Welcome for any further query to Chat Doctor. Hit, thanks. Good Day. Chat Doctor. N."
