  "Q": "Hello, 5 yrs ago I went to the dr with a pea sized lump in my left breast that was very sore. You could not feel it from the outside but it felt like a pebble in your shoe.they advised me to take vitamin d and quit coffee.now the pea sized lump is the size of a large grape and there is a new one that ive just noticed. I am self employed and do not have insurance. Ive heard cancer does not hurt and these do. Should I worry?",
  "A": "Thank you for asking Chat Doctor. My name is Chat Doctor. You have mentioned that you had pea size lump in your breast which has now enlarged ...one of the key indication for breast evaluation by physician is Increase in size of already existing breast lump. I understand that you have mentioned your self employment and having No insurance then it doesn't mean that you should Neglect such lesions. Remember that breast lumps are common. Most often they're noncancerous (benign), particularly in younger women. Still, no matter how old you are, It's important to have any breast lump evaluated by a doctorBreast lumps can be caused by different reasonslike infections, injuries, non-cancerous growths, and cancer you should consult your physician (GP)/Breast physician for early assessment and work up since its recommended and early detection and treatment of breast pathologies have better outcome with good prognosis. Hope this may help you. Let me know if anything is not clear. Thanks."
