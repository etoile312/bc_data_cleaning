  "Q": "My daughter was diagnosed with stage 2 breast cancer in July, 2013. She opted not to do chemo and traditional treatments and chose instead to do all natural treatments. Now, 1 year later, she went to Cancer Treatment Center Of America and now has stage 4 breast cancer, cancer in her lungs and in her bones. I just would like to know if you can give me some idea of life expectancy for something this severe. Also, her dr gave her hormones and told her that would keep the cancer from spreading and that she can do that for 3 months while she decides if she wants to do chemo. TRUE OR FALSE???",
  "A": "The reason that the cancer returned and in a more severe form is because your daughter opted for a non-scientific method of treatment and so was under-treated. Based on her stage and extent of disease now, she should immediately start on chemotherapy and not waste time thinking about it. Hormone therapy in her case will be inferior to chemotherapy. Of course, she should be fit enough to tolerate chemotherapy which only her treating physician can tell. With proper treatment and good response to chemotherapy, her chances of living 5 years is 30% and her median survival will be 18 months."
