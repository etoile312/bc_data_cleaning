  "Q": "I had a routine blood test because of a few health issues that were happening around the same time: thigh pain, knee pain, painful bump on a finger and rough skin that appeared on my left toes but not right toes. All occurred within a month of each other (normally, I am in good health but did have breast cancer 6 years ago resulting in a mastectomy and chemotherapy).My primary physician wanted my oncologist to look at the Alkaline Phosphatase level was was 180 to I think make sure it wasnt anything to do with cancer but my oncologist just had her secretary call to refer me back to the primary without wanting any more info from me. Do I need to be concerned? What is my next step?",
  "A": "Hi, Thanks for writing in. Alkaline phosphatase is an enzyme that is found in the liver in good amounts. Its levels show a state of health and disease and is considered an important liver function marker. In conditions of the liver, damaged liver cells release increased amounts of the enzyme into the blood. This test is often used to detect blocked bile ducts because alkaline phosphatase is in cells of bile ducts. In jaundice patients the alkaline phosphatase levels are raised. In some cancers the sudden rise of alkaline phosphatase by more than 120 units over 4 to 6 weeks is a concern and might require more detailed evaluation. If your earlier alkaline phosphatase was less than 60, and now it is 180 then it is a concern. If past reports show the enzyme almost same as the present level then there is no serious concern. Please do not worry."
