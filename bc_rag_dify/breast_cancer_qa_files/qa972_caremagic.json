  "A": "Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. You have lump in breast under nipple.  It can be due to cyst, gynecomastia or breast cancer.  You should go for ultrasound study and biopsy of that lump. It will give you exact diagnosis. Then you should take treatment accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health."
