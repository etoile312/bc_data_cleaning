  "Q": "I am a breast cancer servivor. Have had a waxy tongue and waxy roof of mouth for a couple of weeks now. I feel tired and dragging most of the time, constipated most of the time. Had a chest tightness and heavy breathing a couple of days ago that ended me up in the ER, but all the x-rays and results came back fine, besides I feel bloated no matter what and how much I eat. Any suggestions?!",
  "A": "Waxy oral cavity can be due to multiple causes. If you are a smoker, first thing you need to do is to stop smoking. Then you can see your physician to look for other causes like fungal infection, malnutrition, etc. All this can be part of steps also since you also have chest discomfort which can be due to acid reflux. Practice YOGA and go for relaxation exercises which would do a lot of good to you"
