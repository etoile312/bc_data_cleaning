  "A": "Hello and welcome to Chat Doctor I would keep a possibility of fungal infection. This is because closely apposing body folds e.g. thighs and groin, maxilla, submammary folds etc. can trap sweat, heat and moisture, therefore making the area favorable for fungal proliferation. If I was the treating doctor I would have asked you to use a topical antifungal like clotrimazole/ketoconazole/fluconazole cream, twice daily, regularly for 4 weeks. An Oral antifungal e.g. fluconazole once weekly for4 -6 weeks OR oral terminating once daily for 2-4 weeks OR Itraconazole 100 mg capsule, 2 capsules once daily for a week, is also advisable for a more complete urban OTC antihistamine e.g. cetirizine 10 mg once daily would help you in symptomatic itch relief. Keeping the folds Chat Doctor. Regards"
