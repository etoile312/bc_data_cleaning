  "Q": "i found a lump under my right breast... and sense I found the lump.. just last sunday it has gotten bigger.. I had a mammogram and a ultra done and they want to send me for a biopsy next monday.. it started out as just a irritant but has grown into a achy pain.. I get shortness of breath and at times half of my right arm will go num.. can that lump press on my lung causing my shortness of breath and why is my arm going num.. plus what can I do to ease the pain.. I got inflamatory med. but cant take it till after biopsy due to its a blood thinner..just taking tylonal right now..",
  "A": "Hi. Thanks for your query and an elucidated history. The lump in the breast has to be biopsied, and you have an appointment for it. It is very rare to have the lump to grow into the lungs, so practically impossible for the lump to cause the shortness of breath. There may be a problem in the lung only. The numbness in the right arm can have a reason in the neck or the cervical spine. Form the history you have provided, I would suggest you to go for MRI of the cervical spine and neck soft tissue to watch for either the disc or secondary lymph node. So also to go for CT scan Chest for condition of the lung/ lump and possibility of cancer and its complications. It is not for sure that this is cancer only, but you have to get this ruled out and get a proper treatment at the earliest."
