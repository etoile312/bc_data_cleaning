  "A": "Hi.it is best if you consult with a doctor, preferably a general surgeon, in regard to your breast concern. It could be a simple cyst, but there are other possibilities which we wanted to rule out. To be able to know what that lesion is, a medical and physical examination by a doctor is needed. Further diagnostics (breast ultrasound, tissue diagnosis) and management (medical or surgical if indications are found) will be directed accordingly. Hope this helps. Good day!!~ Chat Doctor. "
