  "Q": "hi a large lump in my chest appeared a couple of weeks ago which has since calmed down, i can still see it slightly but more worryingly i can feel what i can only describe as a long thin lump running from near my belly button to just under my right nipple this sweels up then goes back down and can be very uncomfortable, i am working offshore untill monday and will make an appointment for tuesday, any advice please",
  "A": "Hi, Dear,Thanks for the query to Chat Doctor Virtual Clinic. From the facts given the lump on your chest to belly button seems to be related to your mammary line. So needs to be checked from your ER Surgeon. USG would fix the cause of it. Till then don't worry. IF its sore and uncomfortable, take painkillers from your Er primary doctor. Hope this would resolve your query. Welcome for any further query in this regard to Chat Doctor. Write good review and hit thanks if this reply is helpful to you. Have a Good Day. Chat Doctor. N.
