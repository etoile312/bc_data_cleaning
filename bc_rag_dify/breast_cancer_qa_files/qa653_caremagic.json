  "A": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. By your history and description, possibility of stress and anxiety related symptoms is more. But better to first rule out cardiac cause. So get done ECG and 2d echo. If both are normal than no need to worry about heart diseases. Hormonal imbalance is another cause for breast pain and lumpy feeling. So get done hormone levels. If this is also normal than you are mostly having stress and anxiety related symptoms. So consult psychiatrist and get done counseling sessions. Try to identify stressor in your life and start working on its solution. You may need anxiolytic Chat Doctor.  So avoid stress and tension. Be relax and calm. Don't worry, you will be alright. Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health. Thanks."
