  "Q": "Hi. My Mom gone thru Breast Cancer Treatment & they have removed her Right Breast & they have cut few lymph nodes too because of this her Right Hand has become too Big and she is unable to wear blouse. Doctor suggessted Stockings and she is using it reqularly but no Results. Could you please suggest?",
  "A": "Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern.  She is treated for breast cancer.  Lymphatic obstruction is the common complication in breast cancer, and it leads to lymphedema and swelling of arm and hand.  No need to worry.  Just wear compression stock bandage. It will clear within few days.  Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health."
