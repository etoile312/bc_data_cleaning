  "A": "Hi Banish ! Good evening. I am Chat Doctor, a general surgeon answering your query. Being concerned about ones own health is good, but getting obsessed with cancer with anything and everything is not advisable. So, not to worry about cancer at the present moment. The pain itself points to the inflammatory nature of the lumps in your under arm, and the common cause could be due to a boil or due to inflammatory swelling of the lymph nodes due to any infected wound in the right hand or right breast. If I were your doctor, I would clinically examine both your breasts for any abnormality there, and after being certain about the inflammatory cause, would advise you a course of broad spectrum antibiotic and an anti-inflammatory Chat Doctor.  In case of no relief, I would advise you to visit a general surgeon who might advise you for a FNAC of the lesion for a cytological diagnosis and further management would depend on this. I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem. Please do not hesitate to ask in case of any further doubts. Thanks for choosing Chat Doctor to clear doubts on your health problems. I wish you an early recovery. Chat Doctor."
