  "Q": "I have low IgA and IgM. I have fibromyalgia, osteoarthritis, and had breast cancer 7 years ago. Would any of these diagnoses have anything to the low IgA and IgM test results? Igm was less than 28.0 with normal range 60-263 and IgA 56 with normal range 68-378.",
  "A": "Dear friend, Greetings from Chat Doctor.... I appreciate your concern ... But i don't see any relationship between the Immunoglobulin levels and the conditions mentioned above ... I think you need not relate to them . Infact low immunoglobulin levels indicate your poor nutritional status...you take good amount of proteins like egg, fish, sprouts, take more of green leafy vegetables, citrus fruits and Chat Doctor. . All these gives you micro/macro-nutrients required for the production of proteins ... zinc and vitamin C tablets could be taken if necessary ... take care and do contact us for more queries .... THANK YOU"
