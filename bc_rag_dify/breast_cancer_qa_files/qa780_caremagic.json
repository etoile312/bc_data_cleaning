  "Q": "Hi. I m experiencing extreme breast tenderness and a heavy feeling in them. I am also having what I would consider extreme food cravings. Also some mild nausea but no vomiting. I had a tubal ligation almost 4 years ago. Is it possible that I could get pregnant anyway?",
  "A": "Hi, Thanks for the query.  Breast tenderness, nausea, food carvings are some signs suggestive of pregnancy, but need not always be pregnancy.  +ve pregnancy test/ USG pelvis after 5 weeks pregnancy are the confirmatory signs.  In your case, lobectomy being done, It's less likely to be pregnancy (however re canalization of tubes followed by conception is possible in few patients) If it is not pregnancy, it can be - gastritis, acid peptic diseases, ovarian, thyroid problems., POD . Which have similar symptoms... they need to be evaluated & treated with help of a gynecologist./ general physician.  Thanks.  Thanks."
