  "Q": "Hi , well see I have been on the Nexplanon birt control since 10/17/13 and I had intercourse with my partner in December of last year unprotected and we than we took a break than had intercourse unprotected again in January and I am having these symptoms pregnancy. But im thinking I may be pregnant what should I do ?",
  "A": "Hello, and I hope I can help you today. Nexplanon, as long as it is not expired (which occurs after 3 years) has never been shown to have a pregnancy failure.  Therefore, as long as your device has not been in longer than 3 years, you should be completely protected against pregnancy, even if you are having regular unprotected sex. Furthermore, the side effects that most people attributed to pregnancy like nausea, bloating, breast tenderness, and mood changes are also common side effects of any progesterone only contraceptive.  The reason for this is that the hormone in Explain is very similar to the hormone that is produced by a normal pregnancy.  In addition, many women do not menstruate on Explain, which is normal. So you cannot tell if you are pregnant based on symptoms, especially with Explain. In order to find out if you are pregnant or not, and hopefully to reassure you as well, I recommend performing an over-the-counter pregnancy test with your first morning urine.  That way you will know for sure that you are not pregnant. I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. Best wishes,"
