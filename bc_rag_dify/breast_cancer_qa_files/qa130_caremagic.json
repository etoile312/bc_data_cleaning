  "Q": "hi,I am swati , age-25 yrs. n trying for baby frm last 3 years dr. diagnose due to pcod m not able to concieve . before 2 month dr suggest me to go for  LOD on 2nd of feb n my surgery was successfully done and then i was trying for baby but not able to conceive dr. prescribe me adova for 5 days , fertisure F, and ovacare forte...kindly guide me what to do..",
  "A": "Hi Ms. SWAT, Fertisure F is a nutritional supplement, so is Ova care forte while ANOVA is prescribed in breast cancer treatment and also in prostate diseases. I do not understand why your doctor has given you the medication. POD responds very well to treatment, so be positive. If your tubes are patent you may be induced for ovulation and monitored with timed intercourse. If you are overweight try to reduce some weight as this has significant effect on the return of spontaneous ovulation in POD. You may need Metformin if you have insulin resistance. Please consult an infertility specialist for further care. Good luck."
