  "Q": "I have pain in chest that radiates to my breasts and nipples. I have narrow arteries to the heart st doctor has me on Ranexa which does help my breathing . My nipples have been leaking if insqueze them, a white substance. They also are inverted sometimes. Doctors seem not to worry. Have had uterine cancer, stage 1. Also .3 benign cysts removed over the years on the right breast. Pain in chest could be an angina.",
  "A": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your situation and problem. In my opinion, we should first rule out cardiac cause for your chest pain because you are having small arteries. So better to get done 1. Ecg2. 2d echo. If both are normal then no need to worry about angina or other cardiac diseases. You are also having nipple discharge.  So get done mammography to rule out breastfeeding cyst or abscess as both can cause chest pain. So consult your doctor and discuss all these."
