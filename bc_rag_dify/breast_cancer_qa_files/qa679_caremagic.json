My questions are: - Must i make a surgery to remove these fibroids before i make (ICSI) or they have no influence on (ICSI)? - What s the influence of these fibroids if i get pregnant? _ Must i remove the myometrial indentation before the (ICSI)? Thanks",
  "A": "Hi, Thanks for your query. I read your query and I understand your concerns. Following is my reply:1) If there is myometrial indentation, you need to get mastectomy done before going for CSI.2) These fibroid if not removed will decrease chance of getting pregnant and increase chance of abortion even if you conceive.3) Hence advisable to remove fibroid before CSI I hope I answered your query. I will be available for any follow-up query you have."
