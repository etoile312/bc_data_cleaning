  "A": "Hi! Welcome to Chat Doctor! In most cases, a benign breast cyst needs no treatment unless it is particularly large or painful. If your breast pain is not related to your menstrual cycle, you can take simple painkillers, such as paracetamol or ibuprofen. Danazol is a medication that can be used to treat pain associated with benign fibrotic breast disease but Canal has to be monitored. If your lump is large, growing or is causing other symptoms, you may need surgery to remove it. Hope this helps! Take care!"
