  "Q": "Hi, Im a 22 year old female, medically fit, no Cancer history in the family . about a month ago I had an abcess on my left elbow and I went to the ER and they gave me Analgesics and Augmentin and I went home and drained it.. 10 days later it was almost gone but another one appeared 2 days later on my right inguinal area. I managed this one by myself through draining and applying Fucidin ointment and it receded in about a week. Now I have a tender lump in my right armpit which is kind of worrying me; I try ti connect the three conditions to each other and yet I find myself fearing it being breast cancer or a lymphoma. its the size of a Hammus and its a little red .. Please Dr I need a satisfying and calming answer as Im afraid so much right now :(",
  "A": "Hi. Thanks for your query. The first and the foremost thing is that you are just 22 years and no cancers occur at your age. All these swellings are small boils/ abscess and will settle well with a small course of an antibiotic and anti-inflammatory medicines like Ibuprofen. IT is definitely advisable that you go for the blood and urine tests to rule out anemia, infection and diabetes, which again I feel will be normal. It is best to apply liquid provide iodine to the affected areas as it practically kills all the bacteria, and you may avoid further infection lesions like this. Just do not worry. This is definitely not a cancer."
