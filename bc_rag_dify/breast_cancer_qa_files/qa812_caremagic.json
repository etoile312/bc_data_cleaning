  "A": "Hi, Welcome to ChatDoctorYou have most likely developed back muscles spasm may be due to wrong posture and possibly precipitated by cold. A simple analgesic and local hot fomentation will help you to reduce pain. As if muscle relaxant Chat Doctor. If condition is severe enough then visit to ER is advisable. As you are over weight and a spine disc problem may be there so an x-ray spine to see condition of spine if required an MRI may give valuable information. Please continue to take medication for thyroid and triglycerides. Take care Good Luck"
