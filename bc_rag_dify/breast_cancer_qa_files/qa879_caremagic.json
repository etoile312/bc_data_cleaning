  "Q": "My husband has breast cancer that has gone into lymph nodes and bones in his back and pelvis.  He had problems with his left shoulder which was the same side of his mastectomy.  He had pet scans and the cancer dr didnt think his pain was cancer related.  He was sent to an orthopedic dr who gave him a cortisone shot which didnt help.  Now after doing another MRI they found that there are tumors.  Wouldnt this have shown in the Pet scan??  Could the cortisone shots have made it worse??Why wouldnt the cancer doctor have found this??",
  "A": "Thanks for posting your query to Chat Doctor. There are so many factors responsible for relapse for breast cancer. sometimes small tumor cells can be removed during surgery, and they may be responsible for recurrence .bone pain may be due to metastasis of tumor cells to that site . You need to consult oncologist to receive chemotherapy regular. Steeroid are not associated with this spread, but you should not take steroid to receive pain .take care."
