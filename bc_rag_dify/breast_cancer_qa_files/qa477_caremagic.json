  "Q": "Have shooting pains in upper arm, inside, about one or two inches below the armpit. Just had annual mammogram at 1:00 pm today. Pain started late afternoon, isn t constant, but maybe 3-4 times an hour. Haven t lifted anything or done anything out of the ordinary this afternoon. Could the mammograms be the reason for the pain? Thank you.",
  "A": "Hi, sometimes people do feel this kind of pain even when they have had crutches under their arm. It typically also goes away. I doubt mammogram must have done that, but even in that case it should go away in a day or two. If it persists for more than 7 days and is disturbing or annoying your routine life, we should get it assessed by a neurologist since shooting pain can be due to irritation of nerve roots. I hope this helps do let me know if you have any more questions for me."
