  "Q": "I have stage 4 breast cancer, I had a pet scan done and the doctors discover that I had a 1.0 nodule in my right upper lung. I do smoke, can ethis be mestastsis from the breast cancer, or the kind of cancer you get from smoking? Im having alot of pain in the back under shoulder blade, and when i cough i can feel my lungs hurting.",
  "A": "Hi, Thanks for writing in. If you have a history of breast cancer and the PET CT scan shows a nodule in right lung upper lobe then the likelihood of a metastasis is much more than a new cancer in the lung. Breast cancer might spread to any other organ system and any suspicious area on the PET CT can is investigated for a metastasis first. Please discuss the lung nodule with your doctor and follow recommended treatment and follow up. If it is a small nodule then treatment response is better. Pain during cough is less likely from a small nodule and might be more related to your general condition. However, a nodule from other benign causes should be ruled out subsequently and any other respiratory symptoms are to be attended to. Please discuss pain relief with you doctor to make yourself comfortable. Please do not worry."
