  "Q": "I am a 61 year male on good health, although a week ago I suffered a laceration on my right thumb. I had a tetanus shot two years ago. Problem: In the last two days I feel a needle like pricking around my nipples I notice them in the afternoon or evening like once every hour when I am standing",
  "A": "Good day, and thank you for being with Chat Doctor ! You may be suffering from Herpes Zoster. This is a reactivated chicken pox virus and is not an STD. This is felt as pain in the chest area dermatome in location. Other conditions would be mastitis (inflammation of the mammary gland) - rare in men, and chest pain that is cardiac in origin. I would ask you to see a doctor to be safe.  I hope I have succeeded in providing the information you were looking for. Please feel free to write back to me for any further clarifications at: http://www.ChatDoctor .com/doctors/ Chat Doctor.  Best wishes."
