  "A": "Dear Madam, Though slipping or bursting of the condom during intercourse is known to cause pregnancy, you have very rightly and thoughtfully covered this risk by taking morning after pill; which is very effective emergency contraceptive pill. So the chances of pregnancy due to this accident are very low. Morning after pill contains hormones - Progesterone or Progesterone+Estrogen, which are known to delay periods by few days. Also, due to the effect of Progesterone, breast tenderness and nausea may bother. You have got following options:1. Wait for menses to appear for a week after missed period. Mostly they will appear.2. If they do not appear, perform pregnancy test on the overnight first morning urine sample 8 days after missed period. Earlier, these tests may give false negative results.3. Straight a way opt for Beta Chat Doctor test which gives reliable results even few days before missing a period. If you are not pregnant and still the periods do not appear, you may take Tab. Devilry for 5 days. 4-7 days later, you should get with Chat Doctor.  If you are not pregnant, nausea and breast tenderness will subside subsequently within few days to weeks. I hope this helps you. "
