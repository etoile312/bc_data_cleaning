  "A": "Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. You may have some benign proliferative breast lesion like fibroadenoma or fibroadenomas. You should go for fine needle aspiration cytology or biopsy of that lump. It will give you exact diagnosis. Then you should take treatment accordingly. Surgical excision is the treatment of choice for most of the benign breast lump. Hope I have answered your question, if you have any doubts then contact me at bit.ly/ Chat Doctor. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health."
