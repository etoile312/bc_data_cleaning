  "Q": "I just received results of abdominal ultrasound & Pelvic Ultrasound, which were done because of a varying degree of pain in my lower left abdomen over the past week or so & which is now very vague & sometimes non-existent. All clear except notes of trace free fluid in the pelvic cul-de-sac & mild increase echogenicity of the liver. No masses. All else unremarkable. Should I be concerned about this?",
  "A": "Hello,1) you mentioned two different finding which might not be associated with each other2) Minimal fluid in cul-de-sac suggest inflammation in pelvic organs (commonly in females). Amount of fluid roughly correlates to degree and extent of inflammation. But in any case it requires medical attention3) Increase echogenicity of liver without increase in size of liver suggest either early changes of fatty liver or minimal hepatitis. Both of these conditions can be differentiated based on results of liver function test.4) Therefore, you need further evaluation with 1) liver function test, 2) CT scan abdomen."
