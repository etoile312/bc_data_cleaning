  "Q": "Hello, My mother (50 years old) has been having discontinuous chest and upper back pains for about 2 weeks now. Im worried she might be showing symptoms of breast cancer or a pending heart attack. Shes been under a lot of stress and has gone through a lot these past 5 months, is there a possible chance that these pains are a result of stress? Also, my mothers sister and mother were diagnosed and both died of breast cancer, so its in the family. Ive been begging her to go get a mammogram and a blood test. She finally agreed to it and went to the clinic for a blood test today--the results will be out in 10 days and then shed go ahead and get a mammogram. But please, any kind of help until then would be much appreciated. Thank you.",
  "A": "HelloWelcome to Chat Doctor Chest and back pain are non-specific symptoms and can occur in so many conditions including stress and anxiety. She should undergo periodic screening mammogram and since she has family history she should be more careful about it. Regarding chest pain and backache, apart from blood test she might need to undergo chest x-ray and ECG to rule out any serious heart/lung condition, Regards"
