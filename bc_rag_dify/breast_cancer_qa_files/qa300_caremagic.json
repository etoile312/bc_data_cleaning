  "Q": "I had a rt lumpectomy in 2000 and rt mastectomy in 2003 and dec in 2010 for a brief time and now for 4 straight days I have had pain in the rib area, one certain spot. LAST july my doctor did a stress test and followed up with an echo of some sort and everything was negative. I am concerned about this. Thank you",
  "A": "Hello, As this is more of the muscular pain. The intercostal muscles are landed into spasm post the mastectomy and lumpectomy. You need to do hot water fermentation and do deep breathing exercises to improve the muscle physiology of the intercostal muscles. This doesn't sound anywhere related to the heart issue. This pain is one of the common symptoms of post-surgery due to muscle shortening and with proper physiotherapy assistance, the symptoms can be reduced. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Jay In Chat Doctor. "
