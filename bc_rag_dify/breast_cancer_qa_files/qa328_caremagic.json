  "A": "Hi, you are 62 years old, had cancer breast 4 years back on left side, probably got treated, in April you had diverticulitis, these have nothing to do with the pain, you are a diabetic and on type 1 insulin, and also had enlarged liver these 2 might be related with the pain, it also may be Related to the cervical spondylosis.  So I advise you t consult a physician for diagnosis and treatment.  Thank you."
