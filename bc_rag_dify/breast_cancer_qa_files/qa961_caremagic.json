  "A": "Hello Thanks for writing to ChatDoctorYes, Uterus fibroid may be the reason for infertility. Fibroids may cause infertility in a number of different ways. Fibroid may cause compression on the fallopian tubes resulting in blockage of the passage of sperm or eggs. If fibroid protrudes into the uterine cavity or causes distortion of the uterine cavity, it may cause mechanical barrier to implantation. Fibroid can be treated by both means conservatively and surgically. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GRH) analogs are commonly used in the medical treatment of fibroid. Mastectomy is the last option, in which fibroid is removes surgically. Hope I have answered your question. Take Care Chat Doctor. "
