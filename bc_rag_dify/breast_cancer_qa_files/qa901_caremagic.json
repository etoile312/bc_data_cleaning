  "Q": "I have used a copper IUD for 22 yrs as a contraceptive and it has worked well for me. After being diagnose with breast cancer 3 yrs ago and having chemo has put me into menopause. I had it removed 2 wks ago but have been experiencing what I think are cramps. It fells like I need to have a bowel movement all the time. Is this normal and will it go away. Karen",
  "A": "HIT hank for asking to ChatDoctorI really appreciate your concern looking to the history given here I could say that your history of malignancy of breast and the history of intrauterine device are nothing to do with the present history of bowel movement complaint, if you feel urge to go for bowel movement and does not have any other complaint then this is nothing to worry, take care and have nice day."
