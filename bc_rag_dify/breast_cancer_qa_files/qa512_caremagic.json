  "Q": "Ive had bilateral mastectomy, stage 0 breast cancer, 17 lymph nodes from my right and 7 from my left underarm were removed by my surgeon. Now I have a boil on my nape and i feel another lump beside it. Its quite bothersome because its painful. What do I do. Thank you so much. Good day!",
  "A": "Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. You may have boil or enlarged lymph node.  Enlarged lymph node may be due to reactive hyperplasia, tuberculosis or metastatic breast cancer.  So it should be tested.  Go for examination. If needed go for fine needle aspiration cytology or biopsy of that lump. It will give you exact diagnosis. Then you should take treatment accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health."
