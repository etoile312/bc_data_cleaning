  "A": "Hi, thanks for sharing your health concerns with Chat Doctor! If I were your treating Doctor for this case of bilateral breast cysts, I would tell that surgery is the best way for treating the cysts; other options are repeated aspiration of them and preventive measures to avoid infection! Always use tight-fitting inner garments...and painkillers if necessary! Hope this answers your question. If you have additional questions or follow-up questions then please do not hesitate in writing to us. I will be happy to answer your questions. Wishing you good health."
