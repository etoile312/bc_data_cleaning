  "Q": "hallo Dr, i have a pain in the left breast and i have already seen the Gynecologist. he has said that there is no problem in my breast. is it ok to use ampiclox. or can i continue to massage it? infect in the beginning, the lump was very small, but when started to massage it, it was extended to be big! so, i go on? or i stop it?",
  "A": "HI, Dear,Thanks for the query to Chat Doctor. I understood your concerns about the painful lump in the breast. When your doctor has told you that its normal, Why you want to start antibiotics on your own? Why you massaging your painful breast ? The increase of breast lump-may be -due to increased blood circulation and supply and does not appear to be because of the infection in it -as your doctor has ruled it out. And also there is nothing to indicate in your query facts. So stop all this and take second opinion if -you still worry. Hope this would help you to plan the treatment with Your family doctor. Wishing you early recovery. You are always Welcome for further query to Chat Doctor in this regard. Have a Good Day...!!"
