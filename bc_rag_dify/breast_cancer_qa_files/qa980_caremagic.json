  "Q": "I am 62 years old and have Empty Sella Syndrome. My doctor took me off of Hormone Replacement Therapy because she is afraid I will get cancer. I feel miserable and I know I need HRT. I went to an endocrinologist and all he did was experiment on me. Some medications were too weak and others too strong. Will HRT cause cancer and where do I go to find a doctor with knowledge of ESS? I live in Daly City, CA and use doctors at Mills Peninsula Hospital.",
  "A": "The longer one-person takes HRT the more their breast and ovary cancer risk increases. But there was only an increased risk after 15 years use for hormone sensitive breast cancers (estrogen or progesterone receptor positive) and after 20 years use for all types of breast cancer. The researchers say that the risk of breast cancer after 20 years use is about 40% higher. So, in women taking estrogen only HRT for 20 years, these researchers expect that 49 women would get breast cancer out of every thousand. In women not taking HRT, 35 out of a thousand would be expected to develop breast cancer. Regards Chat Doctor. "
