  "Q": "Hello, my name is Sarah and I am asking for my mother-in-law.  We live in Florida and she lives in Colorado.  Two years ago she was diagnosed with breast cancer so she went through chemo and radiation.  Last month she went for a regular check up and the Dr. just told her that her liver is bad....yes that is the exact words she was told....her liver is bad and her stomach is swollen.  Please give us any ideas of what are we looking at? Thank you a million",
  "A": "Hi welcome to Chat Doctor ... You have not mentioned liver reports. Your work up done with... -Liver enzymes' estimation to look for hepatocyte injury -PT, APT to look for if coagulation affected-USG etc... Your liver is in bad condition means liver enzymes will be high mostly. It can be as side effect of Chat Doctor. . Second there might be chance of cancer metastasis as you have positive history of breast cancer.... So if needed liver biopsy should be taken to look for metastasis... Take Paradise : Surgeon consultation for examination... And further work up"
