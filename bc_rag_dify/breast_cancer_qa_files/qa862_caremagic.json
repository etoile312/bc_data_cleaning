  "Q": "I have an infected cut on my leg, i have treated the wound and kept it clean.  I am beginning to worry now as it is very painful and my ankle has begun to swell leaving it difficult for me to walk and put pressure on my foot. What steps would you advise me to take now?",
  "A": "Welcome to Chat Doctor. I understand your concern. I would advise a patient coming to me with sucChatDoctorplains to keep his leg elevated. Avoid contact with water. Antibiotics like septum twice daily for 5 days. Application of ice pack at swollen site and lab investigation like mammogram to rule out any infection in blood. If swelling does not reduce even after these measures it would be best to take opinion of general surgeon. Hope I answered your queries. Thanks and regards."
