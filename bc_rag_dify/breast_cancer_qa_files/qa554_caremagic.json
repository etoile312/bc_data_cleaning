  "A": "Hello there, Thanks for writing to us. The tablet fer tab is for ovulation induction, And I suppose you took injection for ovulation around 27 May.... As, you mentioned, all the reports were normal; We can expect good result. You should wait for a week after your expected date of period and then do a urine pregnancy test if missed periods. Meanwhile, I suppose you must be on folic acid tablets, If not, please start these vitamin tablets. Good luck. Take care."
