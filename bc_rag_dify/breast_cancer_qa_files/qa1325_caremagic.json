  "A": "Rossini madam, I note with concern your falling sick with malaria often in last 6 years and this time with addition of typhoid but i don't get whether it was confirmed by lab tests and was treated properly after that. Nevertheless, assuming that this affliction was true, you perhaps have gone into extreme RBC loss which is causing weakness and light-headed feeling and breathing problem too and is not necessarily psychiatric as assumed. So the best thing would be to go in for Mammogram and Peripheral smear looking again for malaria and morphology of Red blood cells. Once confirmed as anemia with type, and treated accordingly, you will do well and avoid depression as well. Best of luck now!"
