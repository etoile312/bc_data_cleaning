  "Q": "I recently had a mammogram following a few months of pain, discomfort in one breast. I am awaiting results but since then, only 10 days ago, I have found a chain of lumps have appeared from the upper top breast to the armpit. Some are small and one or 2 are bigger and feel different. There is some pain, sharp shots and burning. Should I return to the Dr before I get the results?",
  "A": "Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum.  As you describe the glands of the malignancy may not be visible, in a short span of time and all at once, they could be a result of the infection in the breast.  Any how to be on safe side, it is always better to have the examination, immediately.  Take more of green leafy vegetables, pulses, sprouts, and protein rich foods to have resistance against the infections.  Wishing for a quick and complete recovery. Thank you."
