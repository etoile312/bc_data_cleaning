  "Q": "I will be starting the Marviol contraceptive pill on the 1st day of my next period for a duration of around 6-8wks becasue I will be travelling and want to skip my period in February. I m a healthy 40year old non smoker and am curious as to the possibility of side effects like weight gain or increase of breast size in such a short time. I don t want that!!!",
  "A": "Contraceptive pills can be used for 6 to 8 weeks. Nausea, headache, irregular bleeding are some side effects of the Chat Doctor.  Side effects differ from person to person and usually settles in the subsequent weeks. Weight gain and breast pain can occur as a long term effect and may not occur when taken for a week. Only after use, the incidence of effects can be known. It is always better to leave a pill free period to allow with"
