  "Q": "i have had a lumpectomy of the breast as I had been diagnosed with a fibroid and this grew considerably.  Phyllodes tumor has been mentioned but not confirmed.  I am 50.  I have developed recently back pain, there contunuously and have started to get pains in my joints and have developed forgetfulness and can get confused.  I am really worried that the phyllodes I may have is malignant and already spread.  I have 2 young children and am petrified.  I have to wait until next Weds for the results of the operation is there any information or assurances you can give me.",
  "A": "Hi and thanks for the query,I am afraid you might a proper reevaluation. It is vital to redo and reconfirm the histologic aspect of the breast lump. This is so because, in case it's a cancer, it could be signs of spread to other structures. It is very vital to make this possibility excluded. Secondly, the joint pain needs to be properly evaluated. Presence of absence of general symptoms like fever, swelling, general malaise need to be considered. Blood tests to exclude any hematologic disease are needed and x-rays of affected joints if you needed. Confusion and forgetfulness might deserve a neurologists' opinion. The psychological component in your case is an important consideration that could explain the forgetfulness and confusion aspects of the clinical scenario. I suggest you consult the surgeon who got the mass removed for a proper evaluation and planning of further management depending on the findings. Thanks and best regards, Luchuo, MD."
