  "Q": "What is causing vomiting? Stage 4 breast cancer. spread to brain and now to spine. putting a feeding tube in because unable to keep any food down. what would be causing this and if this is end stage how long are we talking we were on vacation one month ago and now this",
  "A": "Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern.  You have breast cancer with brain and spine metastasis. Vomiting is very common in cancer.  It may be due to some toxins secreted by cancer cells or due to brain metastasis.  It can be controlled by ondansetron.  Overall prognosis is very poor. Life expectancy is very low.  Consult your doctor and plan accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health."
