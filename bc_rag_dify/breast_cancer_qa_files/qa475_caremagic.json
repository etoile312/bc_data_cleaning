  "Q": "Hi I am a 21 year old male and just this mornin I have noticed a wet spot in my right nipple area as if something has been squirting there. When I checked on the internet it is known as male nipple discharge, im hearing it is normal but there is also a possibility of cancer which i refuse to believe, I need to know what it is though, it is clear liquid coming out of my right nipple spontaenously, it happended while i slept.",
  "A": "Hello, The chance of cancer is extremely low. However, it usually indicates some hormonal problem like raised prolactin and low testosterone. Therefore, your blood should be tested for them.  Additionally, some medicines may create this problem. Therefore, if you are taking any medicines regularly, please talk to your doctor if they need change. Do NOT press nipple as it can further worsen the problem.  Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Take care "
