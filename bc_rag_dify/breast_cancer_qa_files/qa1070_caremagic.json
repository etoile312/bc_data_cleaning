  "Q": "about 3 weeks ago i broke my front two teeth pretty much in half which has made me need to get root canals and crowns but as my dentist is busy right now i have to wait a while so they put temporary fillings over the exposed nerves to protect it. but 5 days ago the left filling came off and started hurting again due to the exposed nerve being sensitive so i went to the dentist and they put another filling over it, then the exact same thing happened with the other tooth 3 days ago, except this one doesnt hurt and isnt sensitive at all, i assume the nerve is dead? so i havent felt the need to replace the filling on this tooth and have just left it, Is this ok? or should i really go and get the filling replaced? also the one that has been replaced has started to ache in my tooth my root and the gum and is starting to get quite uncomfortable is this an infection? what shall I do? Thanks, Mark",
  "A": "Hi, Thanks for asking the query, The filling placed in your tooth is temporary, unless your canals are completely devitalized, disinfected and sealed to the apex you will face pain and infection. I would encourage you to visit to the Dentist and get the treatment completed. Take complete course of antibiotics and analgesics. Placemant of prosthetic crown on the root canal treated tooth is necessary as the tooth becomes brittle and cannot withstand the mastectomy forces and the chances of fracture increases. Maintain a good oral hygiene, use antiseptic mouthwash rinses. Hope this helps out. Regards..."
