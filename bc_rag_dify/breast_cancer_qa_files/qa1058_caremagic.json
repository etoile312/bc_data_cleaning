  "Q": "I am 42. 2 days ago I started experiencing a pain in my left side at my bra line and over the last 2 days it has hurt worse and the pain has spread to under my left breast and I have a warm sensation and tightness of my left breast and if I touch my side or under my breast it hurts to touch. I looked online for possible reasons it could be and I think I have decided that it is cyclistic breast pain. I am suppose to start my menstrual cycle in 3 days. Am I right on this or should I see a doctor and when should I see the doctor?",
  "A": "Hi Dear, Welcome to Chat Doctor. Understanding your concern. As per your query you have warm sensation and tightness in the breast. Well there can be many reasons for symptoms you mention in query like reproductive hormones, changes that occur in the milk ducts or milk glands, fatty acid imbalance, medication use oral birth control pills, estrogen and progesterone hormone. I would suggest you to consult gynecologist for proper examination. Doctor will take history, order blood test and mammogram. Doctor may also refer you to endocrinologist for hormonal problem. For now apply warm compresses, take ibuprofen or acetaminophen for pain and wear lose cloths. Hope your concern has been resolved. Get Well Soon. Best Wishes,"
