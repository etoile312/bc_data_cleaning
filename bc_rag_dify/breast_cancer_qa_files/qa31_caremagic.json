  "Q": "Hi DoctorMy mother has undergone surgery for breast cancer 15 days ago. Drs have removed the entire breast and had sent it for testing. Today we got to know it was 3rd stage cancer..What will happen now? Is that curable? Request you to kindly guide me..",
  "A": "Stage 3 breast cancer is curable. Treatment will be guided by the patients age and the tumors' estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and Her2 new receptor status. Stage 3 requires chemotherapy followed by radiation therapy. If the Her2 new receptor status is positive then she will be given Herceptin (trastuzumab) as well which is a biological therapy. And if her estrogen or progesterone receptor status is positive then she will be given hormone therapy for a minimum duration of 5 years as well. This is just a sketch of the treatment. You can discuss it with your treating oncologist."
