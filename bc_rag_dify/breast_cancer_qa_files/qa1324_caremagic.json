  "Q": "my 32 year old daughter woke me up this morning to show me a very large lump on her breast. it is under the nipple and heavy feeling seems very large and tender. she had a lump removed  earlier this year  on the other breat no cancer. she is on her period.",
  "A": "Hi, Thanks for writing in. If she has had a benign lump removed earlier than this too can be another similar lump which has developed over time. This condition is commonly referred to as breast fibroadenoma, and sometimes it can get painful due to infections. An ultrasound of breast will give more confirmatory information. If confirmed, It's important to monitor the fibroadenoma with follow-up visits to her doctor for breast ultrasounds to detect any changes in the appearance or size of the lump. Surgery may be considered after discussing with her doctor."
