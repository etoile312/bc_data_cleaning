  "A": "HIT hanks for posting on ChatDoctorRecurrent breast infection will need to be investigated. I will suggest you see a Gynecologist for evaluation and investigation. The duration of her symptoms have been too long to think of common causes of breast problems like mastitis and recurrent breast abscesses. I will suggest she take a mammography and a breast ultrasound. These tests may reveal something. Hope my answer will help you Best regards"
