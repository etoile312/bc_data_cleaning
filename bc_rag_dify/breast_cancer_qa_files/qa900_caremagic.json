  "Q": "Hello, I have pain, like a burning sensation and numbness and then pulsing pain in my left arm, triceps and armpit, with a cold, ice like sensation, followed by a searing burning sensation, as if I am having saline solution put through my vein. If I put my hand on my left hip, the pain starts immediately from the armpit into the triceps but goes away as soon as I let my hand rest down parallel to my body. This is a second time I ve experienced this pain for nearly 3 weeks, right after I was examined my oncologist. Twice now he presses very hard, digs into my armpit until I am in pain to palpate the Sentinel node and really crunches it against my ribcage! After having a lumpectomy, I refused to have the sentinel node removed or to follow up on the standard protocol for breast cancer. It s been 8 months since my surgery and I never experienced pain until he dug for the sentinel node twice, very, very, very painful examination. Now, when I feel the node, it seems that it s been squashed and divided somewhat! Is this pain coming from trauma to the node or have I been protective of my left side. I do tend to lift and do heavy manual work...the oncologist told me that he s 85% sure the cancer is in that node and he really wants me to have a biopsy or have it removed! Why? Why am I being demoralized and pushed to think I m doomed? I am going in for another ultrasound on Monday. Every time I asked to see my ultrasounds before and the 3 after the surgery, I am not given access. Why?",
  "A": "Hi, thank you providing a brief history of you. Since you mentioned you get this kind of pain + you had once also + you do regular heavy lifting works.to come to an assessing part of the oncologist it is his job to figure out if anything is wrong. Chances of getting pain after the pressure might be symptomatic but not have damaged anything. Still you are going an ultrasound you will get some inputs as well.let's understand that when u keep hand behind the hip you get pain or else in normal anatomical position you don't get any pain. Why don't you try doing some regular exercises under the guidance of a physical therapist who can help assess your weaker muscle groups and help you strengthen them. You can even rule out any issue with the spine if any nerve is getting trapped. For which an NCV or MRI will be of great help. You can even take the HEL of a physical therapist who can use some therapeutic ultrasound and TENS for reducing the pain symptoms. Improving the metabolism of you body will help it to fight against infection too. With the exercises you will even have improved immune system which may rule out the nodal cancer issue which your once is suspecting as your exercises' indulgence will suppress all symptoms and make your once wrong and make you happy a lot. With the grace of God I wish you a speedy recovery. Never get demoralized by anyone. You should be a fighter and prove that you can make a change for your own self."
