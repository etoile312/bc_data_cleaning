  "Q": "I have a red inflammed knuckle on my left hand. I am also a breast cancer survivor diagnosed in 2001 (positive receptors-radiation only-arimidex followed) 2010 diagnosed with triple negtive breast cancer (chemo, radiation and left breast mascetomy due to serious infection). Could this be related to cancer treatment and tons of heavy duty drugs taken for infection, plus chemo? Or is it the onset of a form of arthritis. What can I do to slow it down. A few weeks ago, this same condition appeared on my right hand on the thumb side but was more extended toward my arm. Thank you!",
  "A": "Hello, As this could be the Chat Doctor.  I will advise you to get it physically examined if it's a cause of any infection which may not be related to the breast cancer at all.  Also using stocking for the upper limb, hot water fermentation and simple upper limb strengthening exercises should help you ease the symptoms. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Take care Jay In"
