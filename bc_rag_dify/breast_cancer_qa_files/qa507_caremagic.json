  "A": "Welcome to ChatDoctorThanks for the query. Well, positive pet scan is a bad sign, but it still doesn't mean that there is cancer recurrence since a lot of pets scan results are false positive. However since this was stage 3 and there is breast swelling and lymph node enlargement, I am afraid that this may be cancer, and you need to wait biopsy and start treatment right after it. You ll probably need both chemo and radiotherapy.  Wish you good health. Regards."
