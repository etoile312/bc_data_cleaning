  "Q": "Dear Drs.  I am a 50 year old woman who was just diagnosed with Breast Cancer.  I have had  bilateral mascectomies and reconstruction (DIEP) almost 2 months ago. I began Chemotherapy TC last week on Thursday, and had a Neulasta shot. Day 6, and my WBC is 1.7 and my Neutraphils are .36, very low.  I was given Cipro and told to watch for fever (says 100.5 in Neulasta guide).  I normally run about 97.3, but am up to 98.9.  Is this a fever?  Should I go to ER? or call?",
  "A": "Thanks for posting you query to Chat Doctor .you don't need to worry about your temperature as 98.4 degree Is normal temperature and mild increase could be due to diurnal variation hence presently no need for medication or investigation. Chemotherapy itself causes tissue damage and produce liberation of inflammatory mediator may be responsible for rise in temperature. If it persist for long time or increases above 100 degree or cause discomfort to you consult to your clinician .hope you are satisfied with my answer.  Feel free to communicate if any query.regards, Chat Doctor. "
