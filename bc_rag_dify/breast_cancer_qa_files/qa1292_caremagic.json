  "Q": "Hi, my mom is 47years old, she weights 78kg and her medical history has been ok until recently that she had a surgery, January this year on her right breast, a lump was removed. 3 months later she felt another lump growing od the same spot where the surgery was performed. She went for a scan and had the report stated below. The two breasts are normal size and they both have normal glandular tissue, normal breast ducts and ligaments. There is a mass located at the upper outer quadrant of the right breast, it measures 4.9 * 5.3cm. There is acoustic enhancement and it is majorly cystic but there is also a solid component and dividing membranes. There is a solitary cystic lesion also in the upper outer quadrant of the right breast measuring 1.6 * 1.8cm. It has regular wall outline but no internal calcification and no dividing membranes. The left breast is normal. No auxiliary lymphadenopathy. When the scan result was taken to the hospital where the initial surgery was done, the doctor said it wasn t cancer and that he had never seen anything like it before. Pls i need to know what it is so as to know the next step to take.",
  "A": "Hi, Dear. Thanks for the query to Chat Doctor virtual Clinic. I am Chat Doctor. I studied your query and understood your health concerns about your Mother. Treatment-From the USG Scan, the tumor seems to be Benign Fibrotic Addenda, I would first confirm it by FNAC Biopsy. For this I would advise you to consult ER Surgeon.After confirmation of the FNAC report as Benign Tumor, I would plan Excision Biopsy of the Breast Lump. HPR study is advisable as your mother is nearing 50 yrs, to rule out any cancer possibility. This is how you plan treatment with your doctor. Hope this would resolve your query. Write good review and hit thanks after reading this reply. Welcome for any further query to Chat Doctor and to ME. Wishing you early recovery."
