  "Q": "I had a complete hysterectomy a year ago and have suffered terribly from hot flashes and night sweats causing me to get little sleep.  I amu unable to take any hormones because of a history of  breast cancer. (My mother and sister both had an aggressive cancer at my age) I am so wasted and fatigued every day. Is there any hope? Also, my neck seems to have dark patches  on it. Is this hormone related?",
  "A": "HIT hank for asking to ChatDoctorI really understand your problem deeply, and sorry for that, your symptoms does not indicate anything dangerous even if its hormone related and would go away soon its kind of phase comes and go which rarely needs hormone therapy, even if you can not take this therapy it does not matter, you can still be alright, think positively, well maintained you HY Chat Doctor. 5 mg at bedtime every ting will be okay, cheer up have good day."
