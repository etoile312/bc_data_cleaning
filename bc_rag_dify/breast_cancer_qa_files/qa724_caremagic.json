  "Q": "Hi, my mother just called me today to tell me she has received a diagnosis of bone cancer which has definitively spread throughout her entire pelvic region. This appointment was a follow up from a recent ER trip concerning her hip, which they said would need to be replaced. The Orthopedic Surgeon was the one who gave her this diagnosis this afternoon. There is also a major lump in her breast, which was not reviewed, but the Doctor did tell her she does not have very long. My question is: What are the odds the lump in her breast (which apparently is very large) is fatal, and what effect does it have on the diagnosis of bone cancer? I have done some research online, and have found that amputation is a treatment option, however, can an entire pelvic region be worked on in this way? I can t see how you can amputate a pelvis... Lastly, the Ortho gave her an estimated time frame of 1-2 years, if that, so how accurate could that estimate be? Thank you! Abby",
  "A": "Hi, Thanks for writing in. The lump in the breast quickly requires a FNAC test which will give us information on the type of cells present and if they are likely a cancer. If you say there is a large lump which has grown suddenly then there is more than 50 percent chances it is a cancer. When we talk about fatality then we have to consider the stage in which a probable cancer is detected at the start of treatment there is disease spread to bones then it becomes stage 4 cancer and this has a survival of 2 years with the best treatment and care. If there is breast cancer and associated spread to the pelvis then amputation is not the treatment. This might cause more complications and the better treatment is by giving chemotherapy and pain relief. Please do not worry."
