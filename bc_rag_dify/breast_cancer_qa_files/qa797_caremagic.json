  "Q": "i am taking progyluton and my breasts have been tender since my last period and it has not gone away. I am now on my 3rd pack of progyluton nd I get headaches and nauseous feeling and now i am experiencing tummy cramps. are these signs unusual? could i be pregnant? or what?",
  "A": "Breast tenderness, headache,nausea and abdominal cramps are common side effects with progyluton. If the side effects persists even after using for three to four cycles, kindly visit your gynecologist for alternate Chat Doctor. Many low dose and newer contraceptive pills like desogesterol are available which has lesser side effects can be tried. Hope that was helpful. Let me know if I can assist you further. Regards"
