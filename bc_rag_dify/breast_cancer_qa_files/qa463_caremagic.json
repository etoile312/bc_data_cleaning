  "Q": "I am 29 years old. About 4 weeks ago I had a bruised left ankle which I thought was a sprined ankle-there was no visible bruise. Then it was gone. Three days later my left calf felt bruised but no visible bruis. Then it was gone. The next day I had a tingling feeling on the left side of my face. Almost like how it feels when a numbing shot is wearing off. I read up on some information and it sounded almost like shingles. But then two days later it was gone. A week later the area above my left breast was bruised but with no visible bruise as well. I stopped drinking caffeine because I thought it was a cyst. My mother has cysts in her breasts (seen by her yearly mammogram) and she said when she gets off her daily caffeine it gets better. Three days ago the area under my ribs on the right side felt bruised but had no visible bruise as well. Yesterday I had the tingling feeling under my nose. Now its tingling on the left side of my face into my hair line and down my hair (occasionally). \"b\"Im sorry- these are a lot of symptoms, but I just dont understand what this could be. I stopped taking my birth control pill because I was afraid of blood clots, and am currently only taking synthroid. Thank you for your time and help!",
  "A": "Hi, You seem to be having a sensation of bruising without actually seeing any bruises. So what exactly is this sensation that you are feeling? Is it numbness or tingling or something else altogether? It might be a good idea to get yourself examined by your family physician. He/she will be able to determine if there is a problem in the circulation, or are there blood clots or whether it is something else altogether."
