  "Q": "I had surgery to remove lymph nodes from under my right arm due to breast cancer.  After that surgery I got very sick and my chest filled up with phlem. A month later I started radiation therapy.  I took radiation for about a month and a half.  during radiation treatment I always had a cough accompany by mucus.  Its been a month since I finish my radiation therapy and I dont cough that much, but my sinus continues to drain into my system and at night I feel a very small pressure in my chest.  I dont cough that much anymore but there is still mucus in my chest.  should i worry",
  "A": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. Radiotherapy causes irritation and inflammation of lungs. So bronchitis is very common after radiotherapy for breast cancer. And your symptoms like chest congestion, chest tightness, excessive phlegm etc. are common symptoms of bronchitis. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system and PFT (pulmonary function test). PFT will not only diagnose bronchitis, but it will also tell you about severity of the disease and treatment is based on severity only. You will mostly improve with inhaled bronchodilator and inhaled corticosteroids. Don't worry, you will be alright. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks."
