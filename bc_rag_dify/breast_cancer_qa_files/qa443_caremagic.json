  "Q": "Hi I have a small pea sized lump on my head slightly above the left temple. It been there for quite awhile and has not grow. I do get really bad migraines but they have lessened over the years. I have read about this type of situation and I am trying to figure out if its a cyst or something worse. There is history of cancer in my family, my mother passed away from breast cancer 1 year ago at age 42.",
  "A": "HiT hanks for askingBased on your query and history, my opinion is1. The swelling in your case is long-standing, without any increase in size, most probably a benign lesion.2. To find out the nature of lump, you can get a fine needle aspiration (FNAC) done. 3. Based on the findings on FNAC, you can decide to go for excision considering the smaller size of lesion4. Cysts are quite common on head and neck region, so it is most probably a benign cystic lesion5. It's not related to migraine and not to worry much Hope this helps"
