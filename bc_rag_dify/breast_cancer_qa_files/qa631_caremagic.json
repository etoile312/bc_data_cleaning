  "A": "Welcome to Chat Doctor .1. You are feeling a lump, but your doctor says it's normal.2. You don't have any symptoms related to the breast.3. So to confirm the presence / absence of the lump in the breast.4. Get an ultrasound (non-invasive and confirmatory) to evaluate the breast mass.5. Get appointment with your doctor and request for ultrasound scan indication. Anything to ask ? Do not hesitate. Thank you."
