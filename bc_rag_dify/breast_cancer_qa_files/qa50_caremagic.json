  "Q": "How can I take to lose weight in the stomach area? I have hypothyroid, had a pituatoy tumor that was removed w/o being maligment, diagnosed w/breast cancer last July...but caught it early. I did not have to do chemo nor radiation. Only takes tamoxifen daily for 5 yrs. Please help!!!!!",
  "A": "Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum.  As you describe it appears to be the hypothyroidism, which is causing the bulky stomach.  As you are taking tamoxifen since 5 years, the uterus should be screened regularly, as it may cause the uterine cancer.  I advise you to consult a gynecologist for diagnosis and treatment. You may need to have an M.R.I. for diagnosis.  Avid taking fatty foods, junk foods, oily foods.  Wishing for a quick and complete recovery. Thank you."
