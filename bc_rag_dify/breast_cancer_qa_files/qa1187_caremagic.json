  "Q": "I had breast cancer in 2013, did well until July of 2015. I was diagnosed with terminal bone cancer then. I. Had been doing well with treatment at Cleveland Clinic until recently. Liver is showing increased growth but little. I just read the 10 signs for liver problems & I have a lot of the abdominal issues. Is there any thing connected to my diet that might help?",
  "A": "Hello, Your abdominal issue could be due to gastritis like a problem. It can be due to medication intake as well. Kindly mention the gastric symptoms in detail to comment further.  The liver could be enlarged due to many causes. But as you have cancer history I suggest investigating with USG abdomen scan and revert with any reports if done.  Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Take care Chat Doctor. "
