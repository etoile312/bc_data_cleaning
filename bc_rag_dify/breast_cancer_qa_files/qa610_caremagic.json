  "Q": "2 years ago during an mri the doctors found a brain tumor. It is a 8x16mm diameter meningioma with homogeneous enhancement an sharp circumscription along the inner table of the left frontal bone. 5 years ago I went through chemo with breast cancer and 25 years ago I had uterine cancer. When I research this brain tumor it says that it should be removed but the doctor is saying that until more of a problem we should leave it alone and do another mri in 1 year. When research I have all the issues that you can have with this tumor and yet the doctor says systems not so bad let s wait and watch. I have been trying to get an answer on a number of issues that seem to just be getting worse and I just keep getting handed another pill. What can I do?",
  "A": "Hello. I have been through your question and understand your concern. Meningiomas are benign conditions and with very slow growing pattern. That is the reason that unless they do not have any clinical correlation, it is better to have a conservative approach with wait and watch strategy. This is because at this point surgery risk outweigh the tumor itself risks. Hope this helps. Wish you the best health"
