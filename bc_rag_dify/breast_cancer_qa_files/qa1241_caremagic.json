  "Q": "dear doctor, i noticed a wart-like growth on my left nipple , same colour as the nipple. it s about half the size of the nipple. no pain, no discharge . i have had severe eczema which has affected the nipples as well, causing skin to peel and bleeding from the raw skin. i have also experienced a slight rash on my breasts last time but i don t know if it was due to my skin being sensitive. i am a 24-year old female, not married, not sexually active. i do not take drugs or alcohol or any daily medications or supplements . would appreciate your input. thank you.",
  "A": "Hi, Thanks for writing in Chat Doctor. The condition can be allergic contact dermatitis, atomic dermatitis etc. Diagnosis cannot be made without visual clue.Also, few cases of breast cancer can present with edematous skin lesions of skin over breast and nipple. A visit to dermatologist will confirm the diagnosis. Skin biopsy may be required for diagnosis. I urge you to visit dermatologist at earliest for proper diagnosis. Till the time you can take tab. Cetirizine 10 mg twice daily. It will decrease itching.Also, you may apply mild steroid like HY Chat Doctor. Hope this helps. Regards"
