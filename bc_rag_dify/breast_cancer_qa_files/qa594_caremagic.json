  "Q": "Hi Doc,    My mother is 62 years old and is hypertensive.  Shes a breast cancer survivor too who is cancer free for more than 5 years now.  She recently had a blood test and her SGPT/ALT reading is 52 which is above normal.  What causes this to elevate and what can she do to lower it? Thanx.Nikki",
  "A": "Hello Thanks for writing to ChatDoctorIncreased SGPT indicates liver injury. Increase in SGPT may be due to many reasons like hepatitis, alcohol intake, altered lipid profile, medicines,autoimmune causes etc. Your mother need proper evaluation. She needs few more investigations like random blood sugar(RBS), renal function test(RFT), lipid profile, GGT level, complete liver function test, urine RE/ME. She should avoid red meat and high fat milk products. She should avoid fried and junk food. Medicines should be prescribed after complete investigations. I suggest my patients to take tablet ursodeoxycholic acid 300 mg twice daily after food for three months. This help in regeneration of liver cells. Get well soon. Hope I have answered your question. Take Care Chat Doctor. "
