  "Q": "Thank you for being there. I had a rectal seal repair a year after my last birth in 1990. Sex has become painful. Now I have pain in that area in the middle of the night that wakes me. The roof of my mouth has blisters now and I am feeling very tired even after 8 hours of sleep. I am 63 year old. Both of my breasts have sore nipples and the left one is dimpled. I had 3 pollyps removed during 2009 colonoscopy. I also had a clear mammogram in 2009. My mother died of breast cancer and my grand mother of colon cancer.",
  "A": "Hi, Both breast cancer n polyp are inherited disorder. You have mentioned that one of your breast has dimpled, so you should meet an oncologist. After rectal seal repair pain occurs but not after 23Â years. Probably there must be some other pathology. So in my opinion meet a surgeon for bronchoscopic examination n breast examination as well and remain in follow up every 6 months in all reports normal.  Thanks n regards"
