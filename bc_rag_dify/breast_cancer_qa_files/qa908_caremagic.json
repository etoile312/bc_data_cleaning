  "A": "Hi, thank-you for providing the brief history of you. A thorough clinical assessment is advised with a complete blood and urine culture. As you are 64 years old, your metabolism might be slow due to the degenerative changes in the body. Also, you need to check your blood sugar levels along witChatDoctorplete mammogram and urine test to figure out if possible infection is present. Based on which the antibiotics will be advised. Also, you need to even perform some breathing exercises as it will improve the oxygen carrying blood cells which will help assist in healing faster. Later part, performing slow gentle general body exercises will help improve the Cardiorespiratory endurance and improve the metabolism & immune system to fight against the infections. For weakness in a later stage, physical therapy will help improve the strength in the particular group of muscles. In my clinical practice such geriatric cases responds well with a combination of multiple understanding of the systems. RegardsJay In Chat Doctor. "
