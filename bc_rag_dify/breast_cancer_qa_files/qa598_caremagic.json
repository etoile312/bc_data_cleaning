  "Q": "i m feeling pain in my lower AAAAAAA i sleep alot i eat plenty i have itch over my breast and my teeth hurts whats wrong",
  "A": "Hello, Thanks for posting your query.  At the outset your complaints seem to be unconnected. Lower abdominal pain can occur due to a urinary tract infection or in women pelvic inflammation.  You can do a urine microscopy to rule out infection.  Chat Doctor.  Check the skin over your breasts. Is there any rash or swelling? If there is a rash, you can try applying an antifungal skin cream. If there is any swelling it is best to see a doctor who will examine the swelling and decide if it needs to be further evaluated with tests like mammogram or ultrasound.  Bad dental hygiene or gum inflammation can lead to toothache. For relief of pain you can take some over-the-counter painkiller, but get tested by a dentist to rule out cavities that need to be treated. Take a diet rich in vitamin C by including plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables.  Wishing you good health"
