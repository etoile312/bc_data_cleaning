  "Q": "I am 18 and just noticed a small lump under my right nipple. The lump feels spherical and is quite tender and mildly painful to the touch. In addition to this lump, after coming back from a vacation in Italy, I have developed a few halo moles which I have read to be harmless. Could these two symptoms be correlated?",
  "A": "Hi, dear. I have gone through your question. I can understand your concern.  You may have some benign breast lesion like fibroadenoma. It's quite common in this age. No need to worry just go for excision biopsy.  Your mole is not related to your breast lump.  Don't worry about that. Just be relaxed. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health."
