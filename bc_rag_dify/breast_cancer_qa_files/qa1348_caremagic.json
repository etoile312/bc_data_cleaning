  "Q": "Hi. I am female of 25 years old. I have been married past 1 and half years. We were in planning stage. But since from two months we are trying for a baby. Last month we tried intercourse regularly that is i between 10 th day to 20th day. As We were knowing that ovulation occurs in between 12 to 16th day. During intercourse all the semen completely ejected into vagina. After sometime means after a hour it starts spilling out. We were in a hope that this month we can get a positive results but it was in a vain. And also the peneteration was medium. Let me know what is the reason of not getting conceive?",
  "A": "Hello, and I hope I can help you today. In normal healthy couples, it can sometimes even take up to a year to conceive. 80% of couples will conceive within one year if having regular unprotected intercourse (at least 2 to 3 days per week). It is best not to time the efforts of intercourse around ovulation unless you have accurately documented the ovulation date, with an ovulation predictor kit or with hormone levels checked at the doctor's office. The best way to try to conceive in the beginning is to have sex every other day from the time your period finishes until you start to feel premenstrual symptoms. Premenstrual symptoms are caused by the same hormones as produced by pregnancy, so when you start to feel bloating, breast tenderness, nausea, or other pregnancy symptoms you do not need to continue to try to conceive that cycle, as you either already ovulated or are already pregnant. There are nearly 6 million sperm in every ejaculate from a man, so as long as some sperm is ejaculated inside the vagina, there is a possibility of conceiving. Many women have sperm leak out after intercourse, however the ability of sperm to swim within the vagina ensures that a man with a normal sperm count has at least thousands of sperm that reach the egg if ovulation has been taking place. So in summary, many couples do not conceive within two months of beginning to try. I encourage you and your husband to have patience. In the meantime, the best way to prepare for healthy pregnancy is to get adequate rest, eat a healthy diet, avoid alcohol consumption, and take a prenatal vitamin or folic acid supplement which can help prevent birth defects. I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. Best wishes,"
