  "Q": "my sister has breast cancer she had chemo and radiation then they found lesions in her brain. She had 10 more radiation treatments on her head. That was 6 weeks ago. Her last Cat scan showed the lesions in her brain were significantly shrinking. Now she has no streength in her legs and her legs seem to be shrinling up??",
  "A": "Hello dear, thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your sisters situation and problem. Actually radiotherapy and chemotherapy breakdown the body tissue. These causes release many chemicals (cytokines, chemokines). These chemicals cause decrease appetite and loss of body mass. So patient feels weak. Better to start multivitamin and protein powder to build up body mass. Ask her to Chat Doctor. "
