  "Q": "Hi.  I just had a double mastecomy on August 8 2011.  After surgeon took out breast tissue, Plastic Doctor put in expanders. I had 350 ccs of saline injected over 2 month period, I am scheduled for impants on Jan 4 2012.  Just last week I notice a hard lump left on my strunum, it moves a little but not much.  I called Plastics Doc and he advised me it probably was a fat globular cyst and he would remove it during the implant surgery.  Coincidentally I had an apt with my Oncologist the next day and he made an appt for me to see my surgeon, which happends to be today.  Any ideas of what it could be?",
  "A": "Hi. Welcome to Chat Doctor. I guess you had cancer of breast most likely for which mastectomy was done. In that case you should do fine needle biopsy of that lump, since it can be the recurrence of cancer. If biopsy confirms it as simple fat lump (lipoma) then you can proceed with plastic surgery. If it comes as cancer you have to follow up with your oncologist for further treatment before any plastic surgery. Regards"
