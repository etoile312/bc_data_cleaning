  "Q": "for 19+ years i have been producing breast milk. also accompanied by pain and multible cycts and tumors. ive finailly had a breast biopsy on oct.9,2009 and the test was normal. {they say} now my left nipple is bleeding out. there is not alot of blood but the burning and pain are unbearable. my doctor recently tested the blood in a tube for a lab test and that came back normal. how is that? i had also just had all my female organs removed due to endametrious (chronic) left neglected for years. i have had hep c was on treatment for 1yr. and 1/2 (hep c is now in remission) now i developed hep b and my doctor thinks this is a cause for my breast problems. i have been looking for answers for years now. all my hormones were and are normal they say. i have a putarity tumor microadoma they again claim is not the cause. shall i just sit back and die or keep spending unneccary $$$$$$ amounts on bullshit. i know my body and i know there is something not right.",
  "A": "I had/have same problem. 5 years ago microprolactinoma diagnosed... as part of inquiries they checked breasts... did biopsy and found fibroadenoma/benign (some websites say this is overgrowth of milk producing fibers, which would be explicable). After biopsy right breast bled, then stopped.  3 years later stopped destined to see if prolactin resolved... breast bled again about a month later. Re-started Destined and it stopped. Recently took POP for 5 days. Almost immediately started again... stopped pill, and it looks to have stopped, given just reasonable pressure anyway, and certainly produces nothing during the night. Trouble is surgeon is talking of duct removal for papillomas etc. etc. and given the history of the above I am not sure... Are there any surgeons with a whole body approach to these things???"
