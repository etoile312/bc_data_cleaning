  "Q": "Dear doctor,My daughter is 18 months old. She had a lump in her left breast. A local doctor advised us to have some lab work done for her to check for precocious puberty. I went two different labs for the same hormone testing and 2 x-rays (for skull and palm growth), but no doctor to interpret what they mean. I have included some information about my daughter, the lab results and my questions.1)My daughters info: Born date: 12/18/2009; weight at birth: 4kg; height at birth: 54cm; As of 05/17/2011: weight 13.4 kg; height: 83cm.2) Lab results for hormones:Lab 1: (FSH =1.07 IU/ml), (LH=0.1 IU/ml), (Estradial(E2)=4.3 pg/ml);Lab 2: (FSH=1.5 mIU/ml), (LH= 3) My questions:a) Are these ranges normal or abnormal for a 18 month old toddler to be qualified for precocious puberty?b) What other testing should be done for the lump in her breast?Also, I have 2 x-rays available. How can I show them to you? Im willing to pay to have your medical opinion on those x-rays.Thank you very much Doctor,Regards,-Tuvshee",
