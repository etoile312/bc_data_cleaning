  "A": "Hi, Thanks for writing in. Since the patient is having headache for a few days which is not decreasing in intensity therefore it is important to communicate to her doctor. She might require a CT scan of brain and this will tell us if she has any disease spread to the brain that might be causing her headaches. It is also possible that she is weak after surgery and chemotherapy. Her general condition has to be improved, and she might be having anemia which is causing persistent weakness and headache. Please do not worry."
