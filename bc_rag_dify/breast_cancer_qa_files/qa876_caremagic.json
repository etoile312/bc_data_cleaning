  "Q": "Hello Dr. Grief, I just recently finished chemotheraphy for Breast Cancer and noticed that I m having liver pain ( or what I believe to be my liver). I m still taking pain medicine for the neuropathy once a day. I also notice that my skin gets itchy once I take this medicine. Could this result in a problem with my liver and should I be concerned? I don t have another Doctor s appointment till August and don t want to make an additional appointment if it isn t necessary. I feel like I m turning into a hypocondriac. Thank you, Randi Leeham",
  "A": "Chemotherapy Chat Doctor.  Taking too many painkillers can also affect your liver. So I suggest you get a liver function test done now (it's a blood test). If its normal then no immediate cause for concern, else visit a doctor immediately. As far as the itching goes, it could be because you are allergic to that particular painkiller. Try changing to a different one. The itching however could also be due to liver dysfunction which will become evident on the above blood test"
