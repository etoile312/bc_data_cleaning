  "Q": "My girlfriend has something she was told is called Griddy Breasts, and has had it for sometime. When you press on them you can feel a number of lumps formed around the the edges but they dont show on the outside. What is this and is it harmful to her? Will they grow more or be a sign of cancer?",
  "A": "Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. She may have some benign proliferative breast lesion like fibroadenoma, fibroadenomas or fibrotic disease, or she may have rare chance of breast cancer. She should go for mammography and biopsy of that lump. It will give you exact diagnosis. Then you should take treatment accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health."
