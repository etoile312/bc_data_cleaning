  "Q": "Is it possible for adderall to cause a false negative pregnancy test? I have numerous symptoms of pregnancy, though according to my calculations could only have conceived as early as the 6th of Feb. Starting this past Monday (the 14th) I became extremely fatigued, and since then became nauseous most of each day, dizzy, weak, headaches, food aversions and odd cravings, raised body temp (avg of 99.1 over the last few days), digestion problems, and am 2 days late for my period. I don t feel like I have a cold or flu, but just am miserable. Could I be pregnant or is there something else that might be going on?",
  "A": "Hello, and I hope I can help you today. Pregnancy symptoms widely vary between women, and nausea, bloating, headaches, weakness, and breast tenderness can all be caused by an irregular hormonal cycle as well as pregnancy. Furthermore, your basal body temperature goes up after ovulation, whether you get pregnant or not. The most common sign of pregnancy is a missed menstrual period. So in your case, the fact that you've had a negative pregnancy test is reassuring, however you really do need to wait until your period is due and if you are late, test at that time. If you perform the test at that time, it is greater than 99% accurate in diagnosing pregnancy. Adderall is a medication that is in a class of stimulants, which will not affect hormone levels, and it would not produce a false positive pregnancy test. I hope that I was able to adequately answer your question today, and that this information was reassuring. Best wishes,"
