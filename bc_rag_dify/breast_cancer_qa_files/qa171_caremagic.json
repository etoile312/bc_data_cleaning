  "Q": "A red lump/bump appeared on the bottom of my left breast yesterday.  It is tender to the touch and slightly warm.  It seems to have possibly decreased in size from yesterday - slightly.  What could have caused this and should I be concerned?  How long should I wait before I get it checked out?",
  "A": "Hi.how old are you? Do you have a history of breast cancer in your family?it could just be an inflammatory reaction secondary to an infection, a bite, a sting, etc. If the lesion persist and doesn't disappear in a few days time, it is best if you consult with your doctor and have it checked. Physical examination will be of great help. Breast ultrasound or mammography will be directed as needed. Hope this helps. Good day!!~ Chat Doctor. "
