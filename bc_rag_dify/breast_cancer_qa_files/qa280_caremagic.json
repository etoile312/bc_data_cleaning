  "Q": "I had two crown teeth put on last October 2014 and at first it felt tight to chew on my right side. My dentist kept adjusting but nothing made any difference.  Ive asked her to redo them and she started with just one and put on temporary crown.  She re-attach it but it never feel right and finally I end up chewing it with my salad and I thank God I did not swallow it.  How can I convince my dentist to fix it right?",
  "A": "Hello and welcome. Thanks for sharing your concern. From the history posted here it appears that you require to visit a prosthodontist. Crown dislodgement could be due to misalignment. Undue mastectomy forces can lead to crown this lodgement.it requires proper adjustment of height of crown and amount of remaining tooth structure. Please see the specialist mentioned above soon. This should help. Thanks. Take care."
