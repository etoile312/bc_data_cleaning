  "Q": "Hello, My name is XXXX. I am having some problems with my health and no doctor can seem to figure it out. Back in November of 2015, I started awaking to a yellowish fluid in my bra. After about a week, I discovered that the fluid was coming from my right breast. I felt around my breast and discovered a small lump. I went to the doctor who, because of my age of 28, wrote it off as a fibroadenoma. I left it alone. I left the country for a few months, and in South Africa the leakage came back worse than before, so I went back again to the doctor. She had a ultrasound done and revealed that I not only had a Fribroadenoma, but also a Intraductal Papilloma, which would explain my leakage. That was back in March of this year. Over the months the lumps have gotten bigger, they hurt constantly, at least twice a day, and i feel three prominent new lumps that have developed beneath my right breast. I have not had a new ultrasound or mammogram done due to lack of funds. I have had blood work done within the last week and they all reveal nothing to be wrong. Not only am I in pain from my breasts, yes the left one hurts as well just no lumps found yet although a tiny one is popping up in the middle of my chest bone. I am also having serious body aches. Like, my muscles hurt like no other as if I have done an immense amount of days labor, sore, right down to the bones. My upper and lower back are in more pain than I can ever remember them ever being in before. My glands swell randomly, behind my jaw area, and my arm pits area. They don t stay swollen, they just swell as if I m sick but after about four to five hours the pain associated goes away, leaving me simply feeling EXTREMELY exhausted!!!! I can t stay awake to save my life. I don t know whats wrong with me! My head has been hurting, at least one headache a day, and I have the worst dizzy spells, EVERYTIME I stand up.....someone help me out here! I cant handle being cast aside as if I m just some crazy, hypochondriac 28 year old. I know I m not crazy, I know what I m going through is not normal! Whats causing these lumps to starting popping up in my breasts, why are they growing, and why am I feeling as though I have a forever flu???",
  "A": "Hi, As per my surgical experience, the issue with both sides breast swelling with supportive symptoms indicate possible hormone disturbances induced fibroadenomas of the breast. An ultrasound of both breasts with hormone levels evaluation is best recommended at this point. Till that time, analgesic with anti-inflammatory action as ibuprofen with paracetamol serves best to relieve the pain and agony. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. "
