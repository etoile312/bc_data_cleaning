  "Q": "Hello, I am a breast cancer survivor, 3yrs out, with lymphadema in my left arm.  I have had flair ups of the lymphadema before, but this is weird and extremely painful.  Thursday night while driving home from work I realized I couldnt grip the steering wheel with my left hand.  Got home, took my sleeve and glove off and my hand was painful and swollen.  My pinky finger is a sausage, the joint where my pinky meets my hand is extremely painful, the palm of my hand is swollen, and my wrist is painful.  Then today I am developing a rash from underneath my breast to my waist??? I was going to go to the emergency room, but doubted they would be able to do anything...any ideas? Thanks in advance...",
  "A": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your situation and problem. Since you are breast cancer survival patient, following are possible causes for your symptoms. 1. Lymphedema. Breast cancer is known to involve axillary lymph nodes. And it can cause obstruction to the lymph flow. And hence painful swelling of hand can be seen. 2. Cutaneous spread of breast cancer. Rashes on breast and painful edema of hand can be due to metastatic involvement of skin. 3. Cellulitis (skin infection). Cancer patients are having lower immunity. So skin infections are very common. So better to consult emergency room, discuss all these causes. First diagnose yourself and then start appropriate treatment. Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health. Thanks."
