  "Q": "hi im 16 and i have two lumps on my breast . my boobs arnt soar but when i press in it hurts abit wondering if this is just natrual because of my age and got to do with growing. im not experiencing any other things.  could you please help because im really scared about it.",
  "A": "HIT hanks for posting your query to Chat Doctor.  Most of the breast lumps at your age is harmless. But still it needs to be evaluated.  Does it feel hard to feel or firm or soft ? If you can make it out its better you get a breast examination by your doctor. Only if he feels it need further evaluation then you can go for Mammogram test.  But there is no need to be scared as I told earlier that most of the lumps at young age is harmless."
