  "Q": "Hi, I am a 3 year breast cancer survivor. This past October, I started to have vague right hip pain, which has gotten worse. February of this year, I had a nuclear medicine whole body bone scan done. The results came back as degenerative changes in the left and right hip, but more prevalent in the right hip. It was recommended that I repeat the bone scan, which I did on June 3, 2014. The results came back showing that the same affects were happening not only in my hips and pelvis (right hip more prevalent) but also in both of my shoulders ( right shoulder more prevalent) and the front part of my skull had thickened also. I was told that my scan was fine and no changes had occurred and to repeat the scan in six months. I found this to be questionable, simply because there was an obvious change within the three months. Both scans were done to rule out metastatic disease. Radiotracer activity in the second scan was noted in places that did not show up on the first scan. I want to know; do I have anything to worry about and should I get a second opinion. My right hip bone and joint have been hurting constantly, mostly at night. My lumpectomy was on the right breast and I hurt there constantly also. Sometimes the pain is so bad, it feels like it is piercing through the back of my shoulder. Could I have early signs of bone cancer?",
