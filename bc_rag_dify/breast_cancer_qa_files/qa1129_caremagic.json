  "Q": "My daughter is going though menopause. She is in excellent health and just had a mammogram. SHe said she had some swelling in her neck. I have CLL and lymph node swelling is a part of this. I never had swelling with menopause so am wondering if she needs to be checked for CLL. She is 52, small and very active.",
  "A": "Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. You have history of CLL.  But swelling in neck is not always due to CLL.  Your daughter may have some reactive lymph node enlargement or tuberculosis or lymphoma. She should go for complete blood count and fine needle aspiration cytology or biopsy of lump. It will give you exact diagnosis. Then she should take treatment accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health."
