  "Q": "I am a breast cancer patient on zometa due to metastatic bone disease. I took it for 5 years but suffered terrible with jaw and teeth issues. I took a one year break and just took my second one the pain in my jaw was terrible and I had ear noise and heart pain. My brain felt like it was cold. Keep in mind though I also had my chemo treatment the same day which was 2days ago. Abraxine is what I am on now. I have been on some form of treatment fo 10 years. Do you think the zometa caused this?",
  "A": "Hello, I can understand your concern and feel sorry for the agony you have been through. COMETA does have many side effects including the jaw pain and irregular heart beat. Though noises is ear is not a side effect associated with the medicine, it might be due to nerve related side effects that can affect the ear and cause noises. However, the doctor had prescribed you this medication because the benefits of it outweighed the side effects regarding your health condition. In addition, chemotherapy with Airplane is also associated with the side effects like muscle pain, bone pain, diarrhea, vomiting, numbness and tingling sensations etc. However, the pains are well controlled by Acetaminophen or Ibuprofen. If the side effects seem too severe, you might need to consult your treating oncosurgeon for advise and possible change of medicines. I hope this information helps you. Thank you for choosing Chat Doctor. Let me know if you have follow-up questions. Best,"
