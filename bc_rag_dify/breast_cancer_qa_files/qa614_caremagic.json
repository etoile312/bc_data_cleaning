  "Q": "I was diagnosed with Stage 2A breast cancer in February 2011.  I have had a bilateral mastectomy and chemotherapy and now have saline breast implants.  For the past few days, I have been experiencing pain between the 5th and 6th ribs to the left of my sternum.  The pain is worse when I breathe.  Is this costochondritis?  A problem with the implants?  Metastasis?  Please give me your thoughts.  Thank you.",
  "A": "Hi, Thanks for writing in. The pain in Costco Chat Doctor.  It is a sharp pain. Breast implants can cause irritation of the nerves in the anterior chest wall causing pain perception. This pain is more localized to the area where implants are present and usually does not radiate to other places. Metastasis is pain due to bone destruction. This is diffuse pain which increases on palpation and focused on the area overlying the bone. It is suggested that you get a chest X-ray or CT scan done to evaluate in detail the cause and nature of problem leading to the pain."
