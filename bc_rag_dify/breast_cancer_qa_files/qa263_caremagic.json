  "A": "HI, Dear -Kathleen. Very Good Morning from India. Thanks for your query. I understand your concerns. I studied your query in depth.-I would advise you not to worry. In my opinion its -mostly an infective lymphadenitis, as it's far from the breast. If it had been -CANCER REGROWTH-it would have been hard but painless-at the pea size stage, but being painful, its mostly infective lymphadenitis for SURE.-Treatment- a-I would advise-Tb-Antibiotic for 5 days time with Tb-NSAIDs, The pain would go and swelling would reduce in 5 days time.-b- If it persists and does not regress with Antibiotic treats-then FDG PET scan guided-FNAC Biopsy of that Lemonade would fix the cancerous nature of it.-c-PET scan would also study the spread all over body- and would rule out the cancer fear and would relieve you.-Oncosurgeon-consultation would be of a lot of help to you.-Hope this reliefs your worry-some query. Welcome for any more queries in time to come. Have a Good Day."
