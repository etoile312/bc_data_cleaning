I am 70 years old and just finished chemo treatment for breast cancer. Thankyou, ML",
  "A": "Thanks for your problem on Chat Doctor. I can understand your situation. In my opinion you should immediately consult pulmonologist and get done1. Clinical examination of respiratory system2. Chest x ray3. PUT (pulmonary function test). Since you were taking chemotherapy, we need to rule out lung infection and bronchitis. Chemotherapy makes patient immunosuppressive and more prone to infection. So consult pulmonologist and discuss all these. First diagnose yourself and then start appropriate treatment."
