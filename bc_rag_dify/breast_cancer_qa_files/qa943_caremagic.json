  "Q": "Hi. I dont have a very regular period but, I do believe that I was suppose to start at the end of September early October. I have not started yet and I have been very stressed thinking Im pregnant. I have all of my PMS symptoms. Sore breasts, nipples, cramps, my face was breaking out, and earlier today I had some clear nipple discharge. I have never had that before. I also had mood swings. I dont ha any nausea. I did have some brown vaginal discharge around the end of September. My partner and I did have sexual intercourse around the middle of September. He did not ejaculate inside my vagina. However, we did not use a condom. But the intercourse was maybe for 10 seconds.",
  "A": "Hello, Pulled out method has high failure rate (around 27%) and we need to exclude implantation bleeding (mostly present with brown discharge) by undergoing one home pregnancy test at the earliest. Other reasons are hormonal imbalance, stress, pelvic infection, old endometrial tissue, over wt etc. In absence of pregnancy, PMS is more significant with above clinical picture and indicates to get period shortly. Nipple discharge may be due to high prolactin level and small amount is quite physiological. Here, you must consult with your doctor for other tests and examination if you don't get your period after negative pregnancy test.In the meantime. You must take balanced diet, Chat Doctor.  Practice safe sex in the future. Good luck."
