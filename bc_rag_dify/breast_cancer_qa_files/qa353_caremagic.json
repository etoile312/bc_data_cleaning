  "Q": "Hi,Im a 22-year-old female. My period is coming up probably in about a week (my breasts are always sore around this time) and Ive noticed a pain in my left armpit. I believe there is a small lump where the pain is coming from, about the size of a pea. I believe this has happened before prior to my period, though not consistently. Could this be normal? Or is this a sign of breast cancer? Im very worried. Thanks for your help.",
  "A": "Hi thanks for your question. Sore breast before periods and during the period is normal process and is due to hormonal changes before periods. The small lump in your left armpit could be a small lymph node. Pain in lymph node could be due to inflammation of the lymph node secondary to breast changes. Chances of this lymph node of being secondary to breast cancer are very, very rare but can be only ruled out by physical examination of breast and FNAC of this small lump. Hope this answers your question"
