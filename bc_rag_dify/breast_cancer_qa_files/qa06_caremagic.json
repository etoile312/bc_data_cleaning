  "Q": "I have my periods mostly the third week of the month ever since I got an abortion . They gave me birth control and its supposed to make me have my periods the fourth week. The first month I took it I got it the third week and now its month two and no period. I had unprotected sex and I missed my period. I sleep a lot some days and less somedays. At first I had a nightmare of a ghost haunting me woke up crying then the next night of my family killing me. Me and my boyfriend have been fighting. I think im getting mood swings I dont know. My boobs arent sore. I get very bad headaches . And I feel extremely dizzy most of my day. I took two pregnancy tests and they came out negative and I also cant see a doctor. What is your perspective on this?",
  "A": "Hello, Oral contraceptive pill has some side effects like irregular period or bleeding, headache/ migraine, nausea/ vomiting, breast tenderness, fatigue, irritability, decreased libido, weight gain & mood changes. These will overcome gradually until your body is adjusted with hormone. However, I suggest undergoing one blood test for beta-ChatDoctor (most reliable) to exclude or confirm pregnancy. Take healthy diet, Chat Doctor. Good luck."
