  "Q": "the duct cells in my breast are swollen and i feel numbness in my shoulder blade. i am a male and i went to a doctor about 8 years ago about the swollen cells in my breast and he said everything was fine. why is this still happening and now i am beginning to feel the numbest in my left shoulder blade.",
  "A": "Hello, I would explain that the numbness in your shoulder does not seem to be related to the swollen duct cells in your breast. Nevertheless, I recommend performing a breast ultrasound and checking prolactin levels. Regarding the numbness in the shoulder, I would recommend performing a cervical spine MRI study or CT scan, in order to investigate for a possible bulging disc. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. "
