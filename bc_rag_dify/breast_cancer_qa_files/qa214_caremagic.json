  "Q": "I have recently finished treated for a grade 3, left breast cancer with lymphatic involvement, sectional removal, lymphatic clearance, chemo 6 1/2 months, radiotherapy 6 weeks of 5 times a week. I was very fit at the commencement of apparently fairly aggressive chemotherapy, as I was told there was a chance of metastases. Diagnosed feb 27 2013, 56 years old. I am a positive person and have been involved in the medical profession. I have noticed a lump just above my left groin, no pain and intermittent. I attend the gym twice a week and do sport twice a week with no pain in this area. I assume it is nothing to be concerned about in regard to cancer !",
  "A": "Hi. Sorry to know the history but happy to know you are positive and careful treatment you have undergone. The area you suggested is the rarest site to develop secondary of Ca breast. At least not heard of or seen to have lymph node involvement at this level. Somehow I have a feeling this is either a lymph node due to local area infection or a hernia or so. Your Surgeon can ell you more on clinical examination and ultrasonography and FNAC if needed."
