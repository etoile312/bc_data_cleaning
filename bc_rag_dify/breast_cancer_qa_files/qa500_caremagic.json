  "A": "Hello and welcome to Chat Doctor, I am sorry, but your query is not very clear. I will try to answer to bast of my understanding of your problem. There are a number of cancers which can metastasize to the bone marrow. Lung cancer, and prostate cancer are the common cancers in men which metastasizes to bone marrow. Breast cancer and lung cancer are the commonest among the females. Did your husband undergo bone marrow transplantation? Bone marrow transplantation is done for primary bone cancers like multiple myeloma, and leukemia. The most Chat Doctor. Chronic rejection occurs after many years of transplantation and can affect many organs of the body. You have mentioned that the functional capacity of the heart is left to only one fourth. This implies that there is some disease process which is affecting the functioning of the heart. You need to consult a cardiologist for the knowing the disease affecting the heart and its management. Cardiac compromise is a contraindication to many surgeries. A good cardiovascular functioning is required to withstand any surgery. Patient can go into cardiac failure if the cardiac functions are compromised. Thanks and take care"
