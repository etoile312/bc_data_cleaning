  "Q": "found i lump under my left armpit in November had a mammogram down since i was due. Everything looked good, they asked for a ultrasound and still found nothing. Went back in December for another mammogram still ok but they wanted a MRI just had it down last friday and it shows a lump and its tracing down my armpit. Now they want another ultrasound. Radioligist says it could be just infection but breast surgeon says no. Not having the Utrasound for another week and worried .my sister died at 42 from breast cancer was diagnosed at 37 .",
  "A": "Hi, If I were your treating Doctor for this case of an axillary lump, I would come up with only few possibilities as listed below. Nothing to worry about this and try not to get infected there!1. Fibrocystic changes in axillary tail of breast tissue or fibroadenoma2. Sebaceous cyst or lymph node3. Malignant tumor! In this case the lump is not mobile, generally fixed, irregular, painless but hard to feel! I suggest you to go for an FNAC test of the lump for confirmation and to relieve your concerns! Hope this answers your question. If you have additional questions or follow-up questions then please do not hesitate in writing to us. I will be happy to answer your questions. Wishing you good health."
