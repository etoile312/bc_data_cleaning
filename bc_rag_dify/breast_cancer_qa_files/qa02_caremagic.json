Im on # 17 with 16 more treatments to go. I went to F/up with my Oncologist today. He prescribed Anastrozole for me to start taking. Possibably for the next 5 to 10 years. I am 73 yrs old, in good health and very actice. With all the side effects stated for the medication prescribed, I don t want to take it. My PET showed I had no cancer elseware in my body. My qustion is, If I choose not to take this medication what are my chances of recurrence and would it be ok if I choose not to?",
  "A": "Hayes with Chat Doctor.  Some breast cancers are made to grow faster by a natural hormone called estrogen. Anastrozole decreases the amount of estrogen the body makes and helps to slow or reverse the growth of these breast cancers. Hot flashes, headache, trouble sleeping, dizziness, stomach upset, nausea/vomiting, constipation, diarrhea, loss of appetite, weight gain, tiredness/weakness, increased coughing, or sore throat may occur. If any of these effects last or get worse, tell your doctor or pharmacist promptly. Before using this medication, tell your doctor or pharmacist your medical history, especially of: heart disease (such as history of heart attack), bone loss (osteoporosis), liver disease, high blood pressure, blood clots. I will advise you to take one anastrozole tablet per day for 5 years. Its side effects can be managed symptomatically, Regards"
