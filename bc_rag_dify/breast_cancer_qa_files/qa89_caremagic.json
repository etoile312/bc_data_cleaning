  "Q": "I have had pain in lower back since January. I asked for xray, showed swelling so DR. prescribed prednisone for 10 days. Swelling went down but pain, burning and annoying is constant. Went to chiropractor and had 5 sessions. Still hurts no relief. My husband found a lump, close to spine and Chiro also felt it said possible lymphoma. Had ultrasound that shows no solid mass or fluid. Dr. knows it is constant pain for me and now said lets do MRI. Any idea if a lump can cause this much pain across lower back?",
  "A": "Hi, Dear,Thanks for the query to Chat Doctor. I studied your problem in depth and I understood your concerns. Treatment for the painful lump on the lower back-In my opinion your-pain in lower back-was fixed by your doctor as Swelling? Which is mostly due to the prolapsed inter-vertebral disc. And not due to any obvious swelling as thought by your husband or by your chiropractor.Don't waste time on wrong treatments.MRI-now done would resolve the issue.Hence, you should investigate it with your ER Ortho-Surgeon, who would treat it according to its cause. From your facts of the query-In my opinion-your constant pain is due to the improper treatment of the ?-Spinal Canal Stenosis, which you seem to suffer from. This could be confirmed by MRI and would also remove any doubts of lump in the lower-back you and your doctor has. This stenosis if present could be decompressed by endoscopic laminectomy or mastectomy instead of the open laminectomies and could be done with almost no post-surgical instability and morbidity post-decompressions. So take treatment from your ER Ortho-Surgeon, who would treat it after due investigations and treat it accordingly. This advice is based on the facts from the history you give and needs further clinical check.Hence, I would advise you to check with ER Or tho- Surgeon. So don't build up wrong concepts and create more psychic complications in you which would increase risks and costs to you. Hope this would relieve your problem. Welcome for any more query in this regard to Chat Doctor. Write good resume and Click thanks if you feel satisfied with my advice. Have a Good Day. Chat Doctor. N."
