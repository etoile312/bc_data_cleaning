  "Q": "yes,  i have been diagnosed with A-fib. doc says its not life threatening. what can I do on my own, naturally, to combat or deal with it. Im anemic, i have high bloodpressure, diabetes, high cholesterol and im in remission for breast cancer. im 63 @220 lbs female.",
  "A": "There are not really any natural remedies for atrial fibrillation. It is not usually life-threatening. The risk with A-fib is the risk of stroke if you are not on an anticoagulant medication like warfarin. Since several others of your illnesses also put you at risk for stroke (diabetes, cholesterol, hypertension) I think you would benefit from an anticoagulant medication. Please talk to your doctor or cardiologist about this."
