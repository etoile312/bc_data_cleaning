  "A": "Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor. Althea is used for contraception in women and also for the control of acne and hirsutism, regulation of the menstrual cycle, reduction of premenstrual tension and relief from pain and excessive bleeding during menstruation. If you are looking for family planning then you can go for it but it's better to consult your dermatologist before you start because it is important to know the cause of pimples. Some women may experience side effects e.g., nausea, vomiting, plasma (plasma) and other skin or hair changes, headache, water retention, slight weight change, breast tenderness and changes in libido. Menstrual irregularities e.g., spotting, breakthrough bleeding or amenorrhea can occur during its use. Most of these side effects are mild and usually disappear after a few months of contraceptive use. Take care."
