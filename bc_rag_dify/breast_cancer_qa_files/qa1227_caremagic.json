  "Q": "Hi doctor i am a 16 year old female and i was wondering if it is possible i can get lung cancer? My grandma recently died of secondry breast cancer which had spread to her lungs, so i was wondering if it could be genetic. I swim 4-5 times a week competitivley for a club and my fitness is good however recently i have been feeling very short of breath. After 50m slow swims i can find myself very out of breath and wheezy even though i have not exerted hardly any effort. In addition i have found myself being incredibly out of breath when just walking up the stairs, and i have to sit down. My heart rate is usually between 56-60 and 110-120 after hard exercise but after slow 50 metres swims for about the last 2 months now my heart rate has reached 140-145. Im really worried and wondering whether or not i should go see my doctor? I am stressed out the moment with my as levels next week but i dont think ithat would be the cause. What do you think i should do?",
  "A": "Hello, There is increased risk of breast cancer especially in first degree relatives and increased almost twofold if a woman had one affected first-degree relative.  But in you there is no increased risk of lung ca. In you, breast cancer currently is very low since you are very young and patient is not first degree relatives. Still you do self breast examination regularly and look for any hard lump. Its possible you are allergic to cold, that's why swim lead to wheezing. Also, you should get your hemoglobin checked which is again common cause of shortness of breath in female. If you are still having wheezing you can get tab Montage LC at bedtime which is an anti-allergic medicine prescribed from local doctor. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further."
