  "Q": "Hello, i used nordette as ecp sometime sept 20-24, not sure. i had my period sept 9 to 13. I normally have a 33 to 34 day cycle. i had to use it again as ecp last sept 29. Both times i drank 4 tablets, then 4 tablets again. The first time, i took the second dose exactly 12hrs later, the second time, i took the second dose 14 hours later (since i lost track of time). i had withdrawal bleeding for both times. i m supposed to have my period Oct 11, but still no sign of it, no symptoms whatsoever, no breast tenderness, etc. which i usually have. so now im almost a week late. I know it may be because of the ecp, so im trying not to stress about it. am i correct or do you think im pregnant? :( problem two is- now, i need to take nordette again, (this will be the third this month), is it okay? or is it unnecessary? did i ovulate this month? Did nordette stop it or delay it? as much as possible i dont want to take ecp again, so if the pills i took before prevented the whole ovulation phase, then i would not need to take nordette now *fingers crossed* should i take it? i know it may be unsafe. but i just want to know if there is a chance this last time can make me pregnant. i also know its better if i just take regular and more reliable modes of contraception and that is what i am planning to do. i just need to get this problem off my mind before i start taking regular pills on my next cycle :) nordette is the only form of ecp here. thank you so much!",
  "A": "Hello, Frequent or irregular taking of Corvette pill may cause delayed or irregular period. I suggest you to undergo one home pregnancy test 2 weeks after last sexual intercourse. It helps to clear doubt about pregnancy. After that, you must consult with doctor for other relevant investigations like ultrasound scan, hormone test etc. Combined hormonal pill or regular pill is the best choice of contraception to prevent pregnancy (99.9%) and regularize period. Kindly, consult with doctor for complete prescription. Good luck."
