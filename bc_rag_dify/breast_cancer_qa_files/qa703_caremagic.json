  "A": "Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. You may have some chronic mastitis.  You should go for biopsy or fine needle aspiration cytology of lump.  It can be tuberculosis causing mastitis or some other chronic infection.  Biopsy will give you exact diagnosis. Then you should take treatment accordingly. It is also helpful to rule out breast cancer.  So consult your doctor and go for it. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health."
