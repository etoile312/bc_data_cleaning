  "Q": "Hi Doctor... I am 31 and facing a problem of erectile disfunction for last one year. My testosterone level 2.99 ng/ml which is marginally low as per my doctor. My doctor has advised me to take Duzela 30 initially for 3 months and after that he advised to take Duzela 40 for 2months more and report after that.. But it s not showing any remarkable results, moreover I m feeling dizziness.I have read in some medical sites that duzela 40 causes erectile disfunction as its side effect. So my question is whether I m under right treatment? Should I continue to take this drug? I have never faced any condition of depression, my BP and blood sugar level is normal and one more thing to mention I take Thyrox 125 daily. Please help n suggest another suitable drug for me.",
