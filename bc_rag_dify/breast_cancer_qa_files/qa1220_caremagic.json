  "Q": "For the past year or so, I ve experienced my upper armpit area becoming bruised and extremely tender probably once every couple months and it lasts a couple days. I don t know if I m applying my deodorant too aggressively that I m irritating the tissue in there or if it s my lymph nodes trying to tell me something s wrong. Sometimes when I have this unexplained bruising it s also swollen, but this time I don t have swelling, just the bruise and tenderness. I m kind of concerned, I m only 18 so I hope nothings seriously wrong with me. I hope that was a decent description of my symptoms. Thank you.",
  "A": "Hi Dear, Welcome to Chat Doctor. Understanding your concern. As per your query you have bruising and tenderness in upper armpit. Well there can be many reasons for symptoms you mention in query like hematoma, muscle spasm, allergic reaction, infected lipoma, infected boil, lymphadenitis or cyst. I would suggest you to apply ice pack thrice a day, apply warm compresses after 48 hours, apply over the counter anti-inflammatory, take antihistamine like Zyrtec and anti-biotic cream. Consult dermatologist if condition doesn't get better. Doctor may prescribe antibiotics like clindamycin along with anti-inflammatory or may recommend surgical removal. Doctor may also refer you to general surgeon for proper diagnosis and rule out breast cancer like condition. Doctor may order mammogram. Hope your concern has been resolved. Get Well Soon. Best Wishes,"
