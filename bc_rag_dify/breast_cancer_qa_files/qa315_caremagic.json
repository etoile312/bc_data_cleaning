  "Q": "I have suffered with anxiety/depression disorder for years - mostly anxiety. I take 30 mg Lexapro, 75 mcg (changed from 100 mcg about three months ago synthroid (hypo) daily. Also, I take clonazepam 1/2 to 1 mg twice a day. At night I take 11 1/2 mg Seroquel for sleep. I m not happy about taking meds, and I believe for psychiatrists it s a hit or a miss. Now dr wants me to take Vraylar with the Lexapro - ( this is a psychotropic drug which scares me). I have difficulty with over-thinking everything, indecision and concentration issues - anxiety. Often I cry for any reason, and sometimes I have a really ugly cry from built up frustration. I don t want to take any meds except the thyroid med (I have done extensive reading about the thyroid and still believe my issues have a great deal to do with that, and I had a complete hysterectomy at 50. Took HRT Premarin for several years, and suddenly my dr took me off of it due to the breast cancer scare - no estrogen. I am 70 now and weary from taking meds that cause balance issues and foggy brain. I do see a wonderful talk therapist in the same office. Do you have any suggestions? Thank you very much.

  "A": "Dear serve understand your concerns went through your details. Anxiety disorders are a category of mental disorders characterized by feelings of anxiety and fear, where anxiety is a worry about future events and fear is a reaction to current events. These feelings may cause physical symptoms, such as a racing heart and shakiness. There are a number of anxiety disorders: including generalized anxiety disorder, a specific phobia, social anxiety disorder, separation anxiety disorder, agoraphobia, and panic disorder among others.  While each has its own characteristics and symptoms, they all include symptoms of anxiety. Anxiety medicines alone cannot cure anxiety disorders mainly because medicines do not alter behavior.
