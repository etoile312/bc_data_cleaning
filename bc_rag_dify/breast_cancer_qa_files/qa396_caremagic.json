  "Q": "I have the Mirena, had it for 3 years now. Lately I ve been having a lot of pregnancy symptoms. I have clear liquid coming from my boob, tired, moody, nausea, head aches, cramps even after the little couple day cycle that I had. The list goes on. Could I be pregnant?",
  "A": "Hello, and I hope I can help you today. No birth control method is 100 percent effective, so if you have been having unprotected sex, pregnancy is a possibility. However, if you can feel your strings, which means that the IUD is in place, the chance of your being pregnant is still extremely low. In addition, many of the symptoms we associate with pregnancy like mood changes, breast tenderness, fatigue, spotting and nausea can also be caused by an abnormal menstrual cycle.  You may not bleed very much with the IRENA, but you do ovulate, and you may be feeling premenstrual hormonal changes which can mimic pregnancy. So to be on the safe side, I suggest you purchase an over-the-counter pregnancy test and perform it according to the enclosed directions.  Modern pregnancy tests are extremely accurate, and will become positive within 10 days to 2 weeks after conception. If you are not pregnant, you should see your women's healthcare provider as nipple discharge can be a symptom of a breast problem if you have not been nursing recently. I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. Best wishes,"
