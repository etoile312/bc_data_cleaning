  "Q": "Hello I am 22 years old my mom died of breast cancer 13 years ago and sometimes well thought these couple of years and now I get painful pulses on my breast I never noticed which breast it it may be on both but those pulses are painful I don t know if they are normal? And I am very scared and I never had a mammogram or anything ? Wht should I do? Since I know I am most likely to get breast cancer. And now my aunt has it too! I am just scared ! And I don t have medical insurance where can I go get checked ?",
  "A": "Headfirst of all, calm down. Do not worry a lot as even if your Mother and your aunty got breast cancer, does not mean that you are going to get breast cancer. Every person has genes which can cause cancer, but there are genes which stop cancer from starting. The most common cause of pulsating pain in breast can be when you would be having your menses in a weeks time. To check whether your breasts are normal, use your palm and feel your breasts with your palm and move your palm in a clockwise direction from sides to the center of nipple and then in anticlockwise direction from nipple to side. In this movement, if you feel everything as soft, then there is nothing to worry. In the end, to remove out any doubts, you can have a mammogram done. Mammogram is an easy procedure and is painless too. It is just an Ultrasound sonography of the breasts. All your doubts will get cleared by a mammogram. RegardsTake care"
