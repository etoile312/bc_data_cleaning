  "Q": "3 weeks after having my son by cesarean I had a blood test due to night sweats (which I think are hormonal as I seem to get them monthly and really bad after having my 4 babies) My esr level was 29 (Im 30 years old) and tested positive for ANA.They are repeating my bloods on the 4th of March to see if they have come down. I found a pea sized lump in my breast two days ago and have an appointment for next wed with my doctor.My question is, should I bring my blood test forward to before I see my dr? How quickly do esr rates change? Can raised esr be a sign of breast cancer? Im going out of my mind with worry.My baby is now 11 weeks.",
  "A": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your situation and problem. First, no need to worry about Cancer. ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate) is marker of infection and inflammation. And chances of breast infection after pregnancy are more. This is due to lactiferous glands in the breast. So possibility of breast infection is more in your case and not breast cancer. Another possible reason for raised ESR is positive ANA (anti-neutrophilic antibodies). This suggests possibility of connective tissue disease. So you should definitely tell all these reports to your doctor. With proper treatment, ESR comes to normal in 1-2 weeks. So avoid tension related to breast cancer because you are not having this. Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health. Thanks."
