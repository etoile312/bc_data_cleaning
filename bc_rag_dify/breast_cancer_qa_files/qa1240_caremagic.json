  "Q": "hI.  My mom had a tumor removed last week which was located near her breast bone.  They had to go under the pectoral muscle to remove it.  The results from the pathologist came back and the Dr. said it was Satellite cancer.  She had breast cancer removed a year ago and has been cancer free until this happened.  The tumor was the size of a marble.  What is satellite cancer?  Is it highly likely that she has more cancer?",
  "A": "Dear Sir/ MadamThanks for your query. A satellite cancer is a tumor around the primary tumor (not farther than 1 inch) and has come from the primary tumor only. A micrometastases is a more scientific term. It denotes a tumor away from the primary tumor although originating from the primary itself. It is not detected at the time of removal of primary tumor by any modality because of its very small size but grows on later in life. Exact diagnosis depends upon matching of tumor characteristics with the primary. None can deny that she can have more tumor in the future. They may or may not represent part of primary tumor. About the possible chances, best is to discuss with your pathologist & oncologist. SincerelySukhvinder"
