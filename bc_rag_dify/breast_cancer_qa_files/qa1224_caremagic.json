  "Q": "My ferritin syrum level is 370. I am in chemo for lung cancer mets, responding well and close to remission. Age 74. Also breast cancer survivor. I am tired, have hot and cold flashes, headaches, night feet and leg cramps, loss of appetite. My most recent blood work shows this number. Is it really so high? Thank you for your input.",
  "A": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. In my opinion you should not worry much about this ferritin level (370). Normal ferritin level is 20-300. And you are having slightly above than normal range. Ferritin level indicates iron reserve of the body. And your iron reserve is adequate. So if you are on oral iron supplements than you should stop them now. And your symptoms might be due to vitamin deficiency.  So better to take multivitamins.  Avoid stress SND anxiety."
