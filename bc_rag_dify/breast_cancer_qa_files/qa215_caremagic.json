  "Q": "My mother got operated for breast cancer recently, and the tumor is around 2.5 cm diameter, reports suggest as follows- An invasive duct carcinoma with a tumor grade 6 on RB Score (Tubule formation-3, Nuclear grade-2, Mitosis-1)Tumor borders are ill defined. No vascular, lymphatic or perineural invasion. Desmoplasia is minimal. Please suggest the preferred treatment.",
  "A": "Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. You have breast cancer.  It is invasive ductal carcinoma. You have very early stage of cancer without vascular, lymphatic or nodal invasion.  Treatment of choice is surgery followed by chemotherapy and receptor antagonist.  You should go for ER, PR and Her2 new status.  It has very important role in treatment.  If you are positive with this receptor then it is very good and receptor antagonist therapy is helpful.  Consult your doctor and take treatment accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health."
