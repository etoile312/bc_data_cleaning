  "Q": "I am 43 and have melasma on my forehead and around my eyes. I thought it was due to the contraceptive pill, which I was on for 14 years. I stopped taking the pill in November when I was diagnosed with breast cancer . I assumed my melasma would gradually disappear, however 6 months later I still have pigmentation. I am currently taking tamoxifen.",
  "A": "Hi Tania, Plasma may not be due oral pill always. It may be due to some other skin disorder. Since you have been already on tamoxifen I guess you have been properly treated with surgery and chemo/ radiotherapy or both for your carcinoma breast. A 14-year-old plasma may not be due to cancer of breast also. You need a dermatologist consultation for your plasma management. Tamoxifen must not be stopped.  "
