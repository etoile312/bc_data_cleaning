  "Q": "Hello, my left vas deferens are very enlarged/swollen - from where it attaches to the testicle all the way up to the top of the scrotum - it almost feels like a big tangled mess. There is no pain, but they are quite significantly enlarged and I am worried about what the cause could be.",
  "A": "HelloThanks for query. Based on the facts that you have posted I think you have infection of the Spermatic Cord(Funiculars). Please consult qualified Urologist for clinical examination and get following basic tests done to confirm the diagnosis.1) Urine routine and culture.2) Ultrasound scanning and color Doppler study of Scrotum .3) Mammogram and test for Filariasis In the meanwhile take broad spectrum antibiotic like Definite along with anti-inflammatory Chat Doctor. Further treatment will depend upon result of these tests and final diagnosis."
