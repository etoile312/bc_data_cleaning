  "Q": "Hi, may I answer your health queries right now ?  Had breast cancer and masectomy 14 years ago.  Has a lump removed under collarbone but was negative 6 months ago.  Now i have a hard pea shaped lump under incision that does not move around.  Could it be stitches or is is something else?",
  "A": "Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. You may have some fibrosis, or it can be breast cancer recurrence.  You should go for excision biopsy and histopathological examination of that lump.  It will give you exact diagnosis. Then you should take treatment accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health."
