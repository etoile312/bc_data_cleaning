I want to know something asap, the lump is not tender but I dont want to wait that long I am scared, please advise",
  "A": "Respected user, hi I evaluated your query thoroughly.* Lump in breast at 65 may be benign or malignant.* Clinical diagnosis has many criteria to be considered other than marble size as - consistency, texture, movements of the lump - changes involving overlying skin - nipple areola changes if any - swelling / nodes in areola - history part of weight loss / anorexia / excess fatigue or else * Kindly consult with all these details as early as possible so that I can guide you in a more precise way.* One thing is for sure that it is not related to implant at all. Hope this clears your doubt. Welcome for any further assistance. Thanks for using Chat Doctor .com & giving me an opportunity to assistWishing you fine health ahead. Regards dear take care."
