  "Q": "I have had a CAT scan on my pelvic area. I am a 62 year old female who was diagnosed with breast cancer in November of 2011. I had a mastectomy as a result. For the past four weeks, I have had pain in my lower right abdominal area. I have also had a great deal of bloating , gas and have noticed some floating bowels in the bowl. The CAT scan came back ok. ARe there any other medical issues the CAT scan many not have revealed?",
  "A": "If your CT Scan is normal, there doesn`t appear to be much cause for worry. You may be suffering from colitis or dyspepsia in which there is excessive gas production and bloated feeling. You may take a course of Taxi- Ornidazole combination, a PPI like Pantoprazole and a probiotic for 5 to 7 days. These will help. I hope CT Scan of upper abdomen is also normal. If symptoms persist, consult a GI Physician."
