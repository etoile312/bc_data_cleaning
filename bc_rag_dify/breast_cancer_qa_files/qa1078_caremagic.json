  "Q": "I ve had the Mirena IUD since October, this is my second one, because the first moved out of place and had to be removed. I went without birth control for less than a month and had no intercourse during this time. The new IUD was inserted late November and I had an extra long period in December (2 weeks) but haven t had another since. I got a new sexual partner at the beginning of the year, we had unprotected sex, I contracted Herpes .. :( but still have yet to have a period. Now I m noticing my breast are extremely tender, I m having clearish vaginal discharge and excruciating cramps, lie-in-the-fetal-position-cramps. I m wondering what in the world is going on with my body?",
  "A": "Your problems are a) absence of cycles and breast tenderness → it is a side effect of IRENA, if the breast tenderness is bad then use any analgesic like paracetamol 500 MGM 8 hourly. If it is severe then add a diuretic like HY Chat Doctor. 5 MGM once a day in the morning on the day of the breast tenderness. For absence cycles nothing much to be done, as it is accepted association of IRENA. b) Pain abdomen and clear vaginal discharge → with a history of Herpes, it could be a pelvic infection, which will require a check-up and vaginal smear examination, followed by an appropriate antibiotic. It is known as Pelvic Inflammatory disease. Also, u may need an ultrasound examination to rule out an ovarian cyst, which is very common side effect with IRENA. This cyst can produce pain if it is infected or turning. A hot water bottle and paracetamol would be helpful. So, to be sure, do plan a visit to the Gone, as without a check the treatment.  Would be incomplete. Do get back to me with the results. J Wanda"
