  "Q": "I am a 56 year old male with a lump in my right breast. I have a mammogram scheduled for December 1 and I m just starting to get scared. I already fight lupus which is most of the time women and now this. I am a manly man but starting to worry that God may have decided to play some tricks on my body!",
  "A": "Hello, thanks for asking on Chat Doctor. Any lump or swelling on the body should be evaluated. Simple procedures are mammography in your case and a fine needle aspiration cytology. In FNAC a fine needle is passed into the swelling, some of its constituent cells are broken and aspirated. Then smears are prepared on slides of this aspirated material, stained and examined under a microscope. Mostly a diagnosis can be made benign or malignant on FNAC. Further course of action depends upon diagnosis. Thanks."
