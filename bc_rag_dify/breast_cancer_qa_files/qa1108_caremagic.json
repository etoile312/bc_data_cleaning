  "Q": "Hi, I have had my thirs mirwna coil fitted in 12 years. With no problems but I had this last one fitred two weeks ago. I had rhe prevoius removed as there was slight signs of coil infection. I was put on the mini pill for 6 weeks. For the last two weeks I have had tender breasts and sore nipples, this is not normal for me ever. Only when pregnant. Is this normal. Also with all three children home pregnancy tests have always been negative. When I have been pregnant. I took a sample but it was negative. Is this normal ?.",
  "A": "Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor. Mirena coil is incorporated with hormones and gives long term contraception. Side effects associated with IRENA include Headache, Acne, Breast tenderness, Breakthrough bleeding, Mood changes, Weight gain, Abdominal or pelvic pain etc. Mini pill also contains progestin which also causes similar side effects. These symptoms should resolve once you stop the minipill. Thanks."
