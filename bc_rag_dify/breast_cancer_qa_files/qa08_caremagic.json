  "Q": "I have enlarged foliate papilla on the right side of my tongue.  I have them for quite some time now.  My dentist did a \"brush over\" cancer test and it came back negative.  However, they do not seem to be going away.  They are also associated with a burning feeling in that area.  Any comments or suggestions?",
  "A": "Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor . I understand you concern there is nothing to be worried, this is enlarged papillae is seen this can be due to deficiency of vitamin supplements, iron deficiency, or due to acidity also. For this you can take some medication by consulting you doctor one tablet multivitamin once daily for 15 days. One tablet metronidazole once daily for one week One tablet Antioxidants once daily for one week. If you don't get relief then consult physician for complete mammogram.  Hope this will help you."
