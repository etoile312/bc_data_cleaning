  "Q": "I had breast cancer 6 years ago, they found a spot near the chest wall and in the first node under the right arm. Had chemo prior to mastectomy and removed 16 lymph nodes. I am currently experiencing the same pain in my back that I did then. Any chance that it may be cancer again?",
  "A": "Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. You have history of breast cancer. SO there is chance of metastasis in the spine and leads to back pain. Or you may have some other cause. You should go for bone scan and MRI spine. It will give you exact idea regarding cause of your back pain. Then you should take treatment accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have any doubts then contact me at bit.ly/ Chat Doctor. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health"
