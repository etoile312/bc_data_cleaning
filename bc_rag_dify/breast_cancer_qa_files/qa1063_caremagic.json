  "Q": "Hi, about 10 yrs ago I broke my right clavicle. I deal with the occasional shoulder pain due to exercise, sports, and weather. But I just recently felt a small lump above my right clavicle, exactly where I broke it. It hurts and it moves around. Should I be concerned? What could it be? Could it have any connection with a benign tumor removed from my right breast about 13 years ago?",
  "A": "Hi, DEAR,Good Evening, Thanks for the query. I studied it in details and understood your health concerns regarding it. Lump caused on fractured clavicle-10 yrs ago-is a Fibroneuroma ?or Sebaceous Cyst with infection?. X-ray of the clavicle and FNAC Biopsy would fix if it's related to the benign breast lump removed 13 yrs back. Hope this would help you to plan the treatment with your doctor. Wellcome for any further query in this regard. Wishing you good health. Good Night. Chat Doctor. N. From INDIA."
