  "Q": "I have a blister on my nipple. I am 19 weeks pregnant. Before pregnancy I had black discharge coming out of this nipple as well. The doctor did an ultrasound on my breast (before I was pregnant) and said he had no concerns at the time. Now that I m pregnant I am still getting black discharge and I now have what seems like a blister right beside my nipple. What should I do?",
  "A": "Hi. Blisters on the nipples or around them (in the areolar region), most commonly occur due to 2 reasons, either due to friction (from clothing, sexual activity, etc.; or what we call a milk blister which occurs while breastfeeding. As for the black nipple discharge, this could be associated with a hematoma in the breast, an abscess, etc.; and will require more concrete investigations into finding the cause as you will soon have to breastfeed. Best wishes."
