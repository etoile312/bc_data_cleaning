  "Q": "i am 26 weeks pregnant and have been having some problems. I have had a headache for 2 weeks with no relief and i have had an abnormal amount of discharge that is an odd yellowish color also i have had blood in my breastmilk and severe cramping followed by diarhea...",
  "A": "Hi. You seem to be having numerous issues; well first please get your hormone panel conducted and speak to your doctor about correction if there are any abnormalities. The headaches could be related to a hormonal cause, and it should subside as your pregnancy progresses. Yellowish discharge vaginally? That can happen during pregnancy, but either way report it to your doctor, so we can rule out infections. As for the blood discharge from your nipples, I would recommend a mammogram and a physical examination to be conducted by your doctor. Best wishes."
