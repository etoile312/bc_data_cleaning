  "A": "Hi! Good evening. I am Chat Doctor answering your query. If I were your doctor, I would have referred you to a general surgeon for a physical examination followed possibly by a FNAC/excision biopsy of the lesion which is hard and not painful at the earliest possible time, and would also go for a mammogram and an X-ray chest considering your smoking history. I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem. Please do not hesitate to ask in case of any further doubts. Thanks for choosing Chat Doctor to clear doubts on your health problems. Wishing you an early recovery. Chat Doctor."
