  "Q": "Dear Sir/Madame My mother was diagnosed with breast cancer end of February 2011. On september 2010 had a mammogram and an ultra sound, but didnt show anything. She is 43 years old. Her tumor had 8.5x8 cm size. She is ER-, PR-, Her2+3, grade 2. Lymps were clean on MRI, but doctor said he is touching something by hands. Her body was clean from mets, but they found a suspicious spot on her back bone, which no doctor coul be sure of what it is. They say probably it is cancer, maybe it is not, it was very small (notice that my mother had always pain on that spot, many years now). She gave the results to many doctors for diagnosis, only her oncologist believes that this spot is for sure a metastasis, but he is calling it micrometastasis. All the rest doctors said that her illness will be determined at/or after 2 years, except her oncologist who saddenly few days ago announced to us that my mother has only 2 years of life. She never had a biopsy on her bone. I m wondering how much true this can be. Can he determine by so absolut way the progression of her health? My mother has only 2 years for living? if not, whats the susrvival rate for the first 2 and 5 years? I forgot to say that my mother just finished her chemo , 4 FEK and 4 DOC plus herceptin. Her tumor cannot be found at all, zero, clinically dissapeared. She will have surgery in few weeks Thank you in advance",
  "A": "Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. Your mother has breast cancer.  She complete chemotherapy and now going for surgery. In general prognosis is very good. 5 year survival rate is high. But it all depends on whether she has metastatic lesion or not.  If she has metastasis in bone then 5 year survival rate is very low. Consult your doctor and plan accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using health to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor."
