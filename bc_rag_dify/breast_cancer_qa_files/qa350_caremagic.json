  "A": "Hi. Thanks for writing in. Any fever in a patient of cancer is usually due to infection. Patients recovering from cancer might have a generalized lowered immunity. This makes it easier for the infection causing organisms to enter and cause disease. Please take your mother to a general physician who will do certain tests to know if your mother is having an infection which requires treatment. Swelling in the hand after mastectomy is called lymphedema and is due to pooling of lymphatic fluid in the arm due to the absence of breast. This happens in many women with mastectomy and treatment of this swollen arm is by wearing compression garments over the affected arm. Right now it is important to treat the fever. Please do not worry."
