  "A": "Hi, Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Since she had sex at safe period that is 8th day and took unwanted 72 with in a day no chances of pregnancy and because of pills her periods has postponed. If you suspect pregnancy to be the reason of delayed periods with the light periods being decimal bleeding, then get a thorough evaluation by your gynecologist with ultrasound scan and blood tests to confirm/rule out pregnancy No need to worry now but get one UPT done. Consult your doctor for examination and management. Hope I answered your question. Feel free to ask me if you have any further queries. Wish you good health. Take care. Regards"
