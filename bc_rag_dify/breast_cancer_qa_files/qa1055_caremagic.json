  "Q": "I just heard from my lab tests and was scheduled for surgery tomorrow and I am a breast cancer patient and they told me my labs were all out of whack that my platlets were 569 and hy hemoglobin was 10.5 and that I needed to go see my oncologist to see what was going on and I was wondering what to expect...",
  "A": "Generally speaking, the altered counts are not associated with breast cancer except in the last stage when the cancer has involved the bone marrow. Since you were scheduled for surgery, I suspect you don't have last staged breast cancer. So, either you have an associated cause for your altered counts like nutritional deficiency, etc. or you have bone marrow involvement by the cancer. A bone marrow aspiration will settle the issue."
