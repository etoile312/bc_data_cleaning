  "Q": "my mother has undergone breast reconstruction surgery followed by chemo and radiation for breast cancer .In the meantime, she has been attacked by bacterial menigities and epilepsy.After that she was o.k. for a month, but now she is complaining of severe breast pain.she is taking placida,simrose 500and eptoin er 300.what is the remedy of severe pain?",
  "A": "Hi there, She is not on any painkillers and painkillers could be started by local practitioner. Whenever there is pain after breast reconstruction surgery, first issue to rule out is recurrence of cancer. Get her examined by the operating surgeon. Once recurrence is ruled out then other reasons of pain could be looked into. We generally advise a CT scan to rule out any recurrence in chest wall and lymph nodes if examination by your oncologist is normal. Take care"
