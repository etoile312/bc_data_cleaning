  "Q": "Am undergoing chemotherapy for breast cancer.  I have had 4 treatments of AC followed by 2 treatments of taxotere.  I will have 7 more.  The last two weeks I have been having diahrrea with bloody mucousy stools and when they are semiformed they look like raw ground beef.  I have been having severe cramping in my lower intestines.",
  "A": "Hi, Thanks for writing in. Certain chemotherapy agents are toxic to the bowel and might cause undesired altered bowel symptoms. It is possible that you are having such a side effect due to your chemotherapy. Please consult your doctor and keep them informed of your altered stools and also get treated for the same. The cramping might also be for the same reason. Please do not wait any longer and discuss with your doctor immediately. In some cases changing the chemotherapy protocol and adding additional treatment medicine might be required to stop your symptoms and continue with treatment. Please do not worry."
