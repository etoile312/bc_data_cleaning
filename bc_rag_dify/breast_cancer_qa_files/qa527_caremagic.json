  "Q": "i have a small pea like lump left neck midway between back of earlobe and neck.  Have history of breast cancer right side for which I have been cancer free 13 years.  Of course, am scared.  Do have appt with oncologist next week.  What could it be besides cancer? onset was itchy.  thought it was a bite or pimple but has not resolved.",
  "A": "Hi, I can understand your concern. The exact site of the swelling clear from your description. Swelling is at left side and your cancer was of right side. Anyway lymph node swelling if any should be carefully investigated. At present your symptoms not suggestive of cancer or something serious. Do not worry at all. Chance of breast cancer recurrence after 13 years is also very less. Consult your oncologist. He/she will examine you and guide you better."
