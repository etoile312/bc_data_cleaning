  "A": "Hi, Dear,Good afternoon. Thanks for the query to my Chat Doctor online-clinic. I studied your query in-depth. I can understand your concerns for a recurrence after a surgery 1.5 myths back.-In my opinion the hard lump post mastectomy -is mostly - local-node-metastasis or could be recurrence of the breast tumor. I would advise -Pet scan with FDG-18 F-radiotracer which pinpoints lymph nodes Mets, which may miss on CAT scan.FDP PET guided-FNAC Biopsy would fix the recurrence of cancer in local infra-clavicular-left out-nodes.-Alert-A review with Onco-Surgeon for the steps to be taken with his advice is a must and urgently advisable in your case.-Hope this would resolve your worry-some query. Wellcome again to Chat Doctor. Have a good day."
