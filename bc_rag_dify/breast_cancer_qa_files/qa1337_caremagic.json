  "Q": "Hello,I have a almond type shape lump in my left breast. It is approx 1cm long and sits above the areolar at about 11 o clock. I have had it for about 5 months now. It came on just prior to my menstruation, and now I notice it more pre menstrual cycle, and less once my period has passed. It feels mostly moveable at least underneath. I am otherwise healthy, and am 29 years of age. My Aunty has confirmed BRCA1 gene. It is not tender. When I press hard at times It is slightly tender, but nothing at all to be concerned over.Thanks you for your help,Kind regards,Lisa.",
  "A": "Hi Lisa ! Good evening. I am Chat Doctor answering your query. Considering that your aunty has been confirmed BRCA1 positive, the lump in your breast needs close observation, with a present physical examination by a general surgeon followed by an ultrasound of bilateral breast and maxilla followed by a mammogram bilateral breast. Your treating surgeon might advise you for an excision biopsy for ruling out chances of any malignancy, although it does not look like from the history of changing size with menstrual cycle, which usually occurs with simple fibroadenomas. The management would at the end depend on the clinical findings in breast with maxilla, along with results of related investigations. I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem. Please do not hesitate to ask in case of any further doubts. Thanks for choosing Chat Doctor to clear doubts on your health problems. Wishing you an early recovery. Chat Doctor."
