  "Q": "Hello, I have a pain in my tongue. I believe it is the tongue muscle, but cant be sure. When I press my tongue against the roof of my mouth, I feel the pain under my chin. Moving my tongue in general causes pain at the tongue. If I press my thumbs under my chin where the tongue muscle is, I can massage it a little to relieve the pain, but it is still there. It is a dull pain at this point. No swelling. Just hurts when I move my tongue to speak or swallow.Mikaela",
  "A": "Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor .com. I had gone through your question I can understand your concern regarding muscle on the floor of mouth. It looks like mastectomy muscle spasm. You need to reduce you aggressive tongue movement for some time. Apply warm cotton for about 10 minutes two to three times daily. Hold your chin while yawning. If I had been your treatment doctor I would like advise. Take medication like Aerosol MR twice daily in case you are not allergic and also does not have any medical history associated with you for a week. Hope my answer will help you and visit us back if you have any questions further to be answered."
