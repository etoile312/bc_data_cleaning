  "Q": "Hi i jus got my wisdom teeth pulled the day before yesterday....2 on the top and 1 on the bottom right. My face is really swollen and its traveling to my eye and it really hurts to open my mouth so its hard to see if it my jaw bone causing the pain or if it the actual socket ...i really need help the pain meds arent really woeking",
  "A": "Hias per the information provided by you, the pain and discomfort you are feeling is the result of inflammation due to traumatic wisdom tooth extraction. The pain on opening the mouth is due to injury to the mastectomy muscle while injecting the anesthetic deep in the muscle to numb the operating site. These symptoms are going to stay for 2 to 3 days more.unless it's a Chat Doctor. Take the prescribed painkiller and take rest for medicine to take effect. If the symptoms persists for another 2 days then see your dentist again .wish for your quick recovery. Take care"
