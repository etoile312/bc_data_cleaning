  "Q": "NASH w/ T2 hyperintense, T1 hypointense nonenhancing lesion in the right lobe. A thin internal enhancing septation is seen at the periphery of the cyst. It has a slightly lobulated contour. I hold fluid in my abdomen and am short of breath after eating & drinking anything as well as constant nausea.Have a history of breast cancer in 2010-Triple Negative...I am deeply concerned that with my enlarged liver & my history that I should be allowed a biopsy or a closer look at the liver. My liver enzymes have been elevated since 2006. Cyst on liver appeared in  2010.I would be grateful for any insight on my situation.Thank you.",
  "A": "Hi and welcome to Chat Doctor. Thank you for the query. These are significant liver symptoms, but if there is no focal lesion seen on MRI then biopsy cant be helpful. There can be certain degree of fatty liver or liver damage due to other factors such as viral hepatitis, autoimmune or alcoholic hepatitis etc. Most commonly the cause is only fatty liver, but you should rule out malignancies since you had cancer in medical history. So just check your tumor markers and LFT frequently. I am sure there is no serious disease. Wish you good health. Regards"
