  "Q": "pregnancyever since I was on the depo shot my cycles been screwed up. my boyfriend and i havnt been using peotection. im having very slight symptoms of breast tenderness..unusual bloating.. nausious but not throwing up exc.. the average symptoms i guess and i was wondering the chances of me getting pregnant after going off the shot and the chance i may be cuz ive also been really stressed.. how soon should i test",
  "A": "Hi, Chance of pregnancy is less because you used protection. Your symptoms could be due to hormonal imbalance as demo shot has been off. To confirm pregnancy, I would suggest going for blood Chat Doctor test, 10 days after sex. Blood Chat Doctor test is more accurate test and detect pregnancy earlier compared to urine pregnancy test. Avoid stress, take healthy diet, Chat Doctor. Hope this may help you. Contact further if follow up needed. Best regards,"
