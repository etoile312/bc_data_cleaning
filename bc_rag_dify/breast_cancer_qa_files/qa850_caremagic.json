  "Q": "I had a total hysterectomy two years ago and was put on Premarin 1.25mg. I also take venlafaxine, (anti dpepressant) . I have been under a lot of stress recently and have suffered with nodular acne which is very painful. I am using Differin medication at night and have tried lots of products, including oxytetracycline anti biotics. Can the Hrt be adding to this vey painful chin and nose scene? Any ideas would be very much appreciated . Thank you x.",
  "A": "Hi. Thanks for the query. May I know what dose of venlafaxine you are receiving & how much of beneficial effects you are perceiving at present? You are taking Remain as HRT as you mentioned. One of the side effects of taking synthetic estrogen (remain) is flaring up of acne due to hormonal imbalance & also there is a risk of developing ovarian, breast cancers with unchecked use of HRT. Considering that you have already exhausted many options for painful acne; you should recheck with your doctor about continuing remain as gradual with Chat Doctor.  Also check with your doctor about use of isotretinoin cream to alleviate acne especially in back"
