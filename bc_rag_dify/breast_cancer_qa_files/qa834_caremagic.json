  "A": "Hi, Thanks for writing in. Cancer is a difficult condition to treat, and its progress cannot be predicted. It requires strict vigilance at every step and the treatment should be modified accordingly. In the beginning the doctors had diagnosed a stage 2 cancer in your sister. At that time the disease was at early stage. After initiating treatment, it is now spread to stage 4. Unfortunately little can be done to curse stage 4 cancer. However, the battle with cancer continues till the end, and she should get required chemotherapy and radiation to slow the disease process. In most cases patients can survive for 2 years after having stage 4 cancer with proper treatment and support. Rarely patient can survive longer than predicted. She also requires pain relief measures so that she can feel comfortable. Please do not worry."
