I guess this has been going on since saturday when she was staying the night at her friends house and her friend said she had a seisure in her sleep.  Shes got headaches and has always complained about them. Now she has a metallic taste in her mouth and it hurts to eat all foods.  She also seems to much thirstier than usually lately.",
  "A": "Hi, Constant pain abdomen, episodes of sudden pain with movement and now pain abdomen with all food suggests for further evaluation. Get done USG abdomen and pelvis, blood sugar and complete mammogram as basic investigations and contact your doctor for complete examination(All vitals and general physical examination) once. She may require CNS investigations after her examination. Give her only soft food now and consult your doctor once. Hope this helps you. Regards"
