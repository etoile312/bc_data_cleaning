  "Q": "hello my sister has been diagnosed with breast cancer. she has invasive lobular carcinoma and a lobular carcinoma in situ. both in one breast. she is getting another ultra sound to recheck the lymph nodes and her pap showed she has myometrial lesion on her uterus too. does this mean the cancer has spread to her uterus and perhaps the rest of her body? she is experiencing burning feeling on her shoulder and leg all on her left side which is where her breast cancer is?",
  "A": "Breast cancer has propensity to spread to lungs, liver, bones and brain. Spread to uterus is rare. The lesion in uterus is not related to breast cancer. Her pain also might not be related, but needs further investigation. Spread to bones need to be ruled out. If the tumor size is too small, then bone spread is extremely unlikely and bone scans are not done as routine work up. Her pain might be simple muscle pain most likely"
