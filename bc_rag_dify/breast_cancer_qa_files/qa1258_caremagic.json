  "A": "Hi, Ovuloc-LD is a combined two female hormones, namely progestin and an estrogen and is most commonly used to treat symptoms associated with polycystic ovarian disease. It is generally well tolerated by most women however its short term side effects include mood changes, nausea/vomiting, headache, breast pain, spotting or breakthrough bleeding and weight gain. The long term side effects include clot formation in the leg veins, increased blood pressure and increased risk of cancer of breast or uterus. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Take care "
