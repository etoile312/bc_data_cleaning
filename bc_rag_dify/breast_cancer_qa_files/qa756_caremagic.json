  "Q": "Hi I have a large tender red circle on the side of my right breast, tender to touch... larger than a silver dollar. In the center there is a round scaly patch. The whole area is irritated and warm to the touch. Its freaking me out. I am 34 and unsure about breast cancer history in my family. Do you have an idea??? My health insurance does not kick in until march... 2 weeks on the new job =/...",
  "A": "Hi, first of do you feel a lump in the affected breast, any nipple discharge, if yes what color if blood its cause of alarm, are you breastfeeding? From the brief description you have given my differential diagnosis could be mastitis, breast abscess, breast cancer.I would suggest get a breast ultrasound done, and preferably see a surgeon for further management, hope have helped to answer your query get well soon and be strong."
