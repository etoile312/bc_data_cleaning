  "Q": "hi, i just got to know from my breast ultrasound reports that i have a well defined cystic area measuring approx. 4.4mm. is seen in the dermis layer of the sin of the left axillary region. both breast show predominantly fibro grandular parenchyma. there is no evidence of any Sol/ Architectural distortion/ calcification . both nipple, reteroareolar region, skin,subcutaneous tissues and axillary tail region are normal. i am 23 years old female and i went to the gynaecologist yesterday in order to check if i had breast cancer . i was very scared because from last 4 months i had some pimple sort of thing on my left underarm . also i felt some burning pain on my left breast and on the underarm too. i also have spondolysis symptoms so i have the pain on th eentire left side. please tell me is it related to any cancer. i am very scared.",
  "A": "Dear Ma'am, Sorry to hear about your problem. The breast ultrasound report appears to be absolutely normal. The pimple which you have described under the armpit (maxilla) is probably an infected sebaceous cyst (infection of the hair follicle) and will subside with time. If it is inflamed and not settling, you can take a course of antibiotic. There are no symptoms suggestive of cancer, but you should continue to do breast self-examination regularly. Hoping for the best. "
