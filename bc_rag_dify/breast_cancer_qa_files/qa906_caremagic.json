  "Q": "Hello, I am a 50 year old female , type one diabetic of 15 years on insulin, being treated with amitriptyline pregabalin,citalopram, trospium, metformin for disc prolapse , nerve damage and urge incontinence, I am frequently having dizzy turns, falling and blurred vision, this combination has finally reduced the constant pain to a minimum but the recently added breast pains and waking up with nostrils stuffed with dried blood is unnerving, I also added ramipril 2.5 mg",
  "A": "Dizziness is non-specific. It can be brought on sometimes by pregabalin or cervical disc compression. Pregabalin can also cause Chat Doctor. The falling could be due to imbalance which is brought on by peripheral neuropathy in diabetes. You need to get a complete ophthalmic check up since blurring of vision could occur with diabetic retinopathy. Monitor your blood sugars and renal function tests regularly. Also get a baseline ECG if not done previously."
