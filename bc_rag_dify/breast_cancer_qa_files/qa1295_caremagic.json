  "Q": "Underneath my genital area on the upper inner thigh I have a patch of dry white-ish skin on each side.....Is this just from chafing? (I am overweight). Or is this some sort of fungal infection? (it is only on the upper inner thigh-not the genital area)",
  "A": "Hello. Thanks for writing to us at Chat Doctor Most likely it is a fungal infection. Fungal infection are common at sites of body folds like upper inner thighs, maxilla, submammary folds etc. Chaffing/scaling is a feature of fungal infections. Itching is usually a feature too, but it is subjective in individuals. Being overweight adds to the possibility of fungal infection. If I was the treating doctor I would have asked you to use a topical antifungal cream. Clotrimazole 1% cream is available OTC and you may use this for 4-6 weeks. Oral antifungals e.g. fluconazole are more effective in controlling the symptoms and are usually prescribed once a week for 4-6 weeks. However, oral antifungals are prescription Chat Doctor. An OTC oral antihistamine e.g. cetirizine 10 mg once daily would provide you symptomatic relief from itching. Once the condition resolves, you may use an antifungal dusting powder in the groin folds regularly, twice daily. Antifungal dusting powder would not only keep the folds "
