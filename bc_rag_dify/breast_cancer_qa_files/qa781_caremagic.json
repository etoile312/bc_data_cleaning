  "A": "Hello, and I hope I can help you today.First, it is extremely uncommon to be fertile during your menstrual cycle. The hormonal Chat Doctor. The morning after pill is extremely effective in preventing pregnancy if taken within the first 72 hours after an unprotected encounter.  The morning-after pill works by thickening the mucus of the cervix and uterus to help to prevent fertilization. If the medication works, it usually triggers a small amount of bleeding like a period 3-7 days later. Therefore, the fact that you already have bleeding is a sign that the medication worked and that you did not conceive. Pregnancy symptoms vary widely between women, and many of the symptoms we commonly associate with pregnancy such as nausea, appetite changes, bloating, abdominal pain, mood changes and breast tenderness can occur as side effects of taking hormones or of an irregular menstrual cycle as well as pregnancy. Therefore, there really is no reason to worry at this point that you are pregnant.  Is normal to have your period be late after you've taken the morning-after pill, as you already had some bleeding this cycle, however taking a pregnancy test at that time (when you are late) would not be unreasonable. If that test is negative, then you can be re-sure that you are not pregnant and do not need to retest even if that menstrual cycle comes late. I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today, and that this information was reassuring. Best wishes,"
