  "Q": "Hello I am 31 years old and for the last 6 months I have been getting swollen lymph nodes under my armpits no injuries no cuts from shaving and I have been fine no sickness I went to the Drs a month ago and they told me that I had a lump just above my breast tissue and not to worry but I don t understand why my lymph nodes keep swelling up and becoming hard",
  "A": "Lymph nodes in axillary region (as a matter,anywhere) mostly get enlarged and become palpable (touchable) to our hands....mostly due to a primary source of infection nearby....in your case it could be infection within breast tissue or upper limb.....but however the problem becomes bigger if they appear...\"hard\" or continuously enlarging and are multiple on both sides(armpits)...and in other regions like neck and groin regions...... In these situations....a malignancy(cancer) arising within lymph nodes(lymphoma) or arising elsewhere (in your case breast mass shut be looked upon as a possible source).must be searched for....... However....a Gen. Surgeon needs to examine u carefully and with help of some investigations like FNAC or Excision Biopsy from the node, an accurate diagnosis can be made easily and treatments started as required.... Regards Chat Doctor. "
