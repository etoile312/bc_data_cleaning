  "A": "Hello, Thankyou for asking your question at Chat Doctor. I understand your concern Taking thermoform during pregnancy is completely safe. Infact it is important to take the thermoform regularly, if you have hypothyroidism (decreased thyroid hormone) and regularly check the thyroid hormone levels. Maintaining a normal thyroid level is important for mother and fetus. The earliest signs of pregnancy occur when the fertilized egg implants on the uterine wall. Some women notice slight bleeding /spotting at this time called Implantation bleed. But most women do not have Implantation bleed. Once the fertilized egg implants the progesterone levels in your body keep. Rising, and you start noticing increase in body temperature, nausea, breast tenderness, bloating etc. However, some women do not experience any of these symptoms, even though they have conceived. Implantation usually occurs around 9th day after ovulation. It can range from 6-12 days. Assuming you have regular periods, your ovulation is supposed to happen on day 14. If so, you are unlikely to have any symptoms of pregnancy on day 20 of the cycle. You can do a home pregnancy test 6 days after your missed periods to detect pregnancy. Now there are also very sensitive tests available that test for pregnancy 5 days before missing your period, but chances of getting false negative results are high if you test too early Hope I was able to answer your question Please feel free to ad Chat Doctor.
