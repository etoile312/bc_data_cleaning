  "Q": "I took my nuvaring out and got my period as normal then me and my boyfriend had questionable unprotected intercourse a few days after ending that period but he knows he didn t finish inside me and thinks I m overreacting but I haven t gotten my period in over a month since last time I had it. My periods were slightly irregular before starting nuvaring. The past three weeks Iv had breast tenderness, slight cramps, tinniest bit of spotting, back pain, acne, and irritability basically pregnancy symptoms .. Is that normal coming off nuvaring?",
