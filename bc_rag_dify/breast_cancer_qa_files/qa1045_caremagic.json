  "Q": "I have been unwell for some weeks.  I have pain in the lower abdomen and also under the left breast.  I have blood in my urine and have had blood in the vagina ( I am 63 years old and years after menopause) I have spasmodic fever, no apetite and have now developed diarhea.",
  "A": "Hello! Thank you for the query. It sounds like you have urinary tract infection (lower abdominal pain, blood in urine). Especially if you have also frequent urinating, burning while urinating. Breast pain can indicate some infection or even breast cancer. You should not ignore it. Please do not wait any longer. Consult your doctor, have urinalysis, breast examination, ultrasound, blood work. Hope this will help. Regards."
