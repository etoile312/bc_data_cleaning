  "Q": "A month ago, I has congestion, headache and coughing.  I went to a clinic and they gave an antibiotic, z-pac.  I finished that and felt somewhat better, then had a relapse.  I went to my dr. and got another antibiotic which made me very sick, including nausea, loose stool, bad headache.  I stopped it and called my dr., and got put on an inhalor.  I tried it a few days and did not get better.  Now I still have congestion, a lot of coughing, back pain, chest discomfort and bad heatburn.  What can I do??  What can I have??",
  "A": "Hi.you have cough, congestion and headache for past few days, and you are not better with antibiotics and inhalers. Possibly It's time we need to take up investigations. Take an X-Ray chest (PA View), complete mammogram, erythrocyte sedimentation rate(ESR), Absolute eosinophil count(AEC), sputum culture. Depending on the results the treating physician should manage the cough. The other two symptoms of headache and gastritis are easy to manage. Right now we cannot predict the diagnosis. Feel free to contact us in case you need a second opinion on the investigation and diagnosis. Take care."
