  "Q": "I had a lumpectomy last April and radiation, finished July 2. Stage one, hr negative. Taking Tamoxifen now. Im 54. Otherwise healthy. 145 lbs. The lobules inside the breast now feel sensitive, sometimes burning, a bit inflamed. They seem to swell and then to shrink. Happens on right breast too.I have an appointment in two days. Just trying to educate myself. Could it be related to estrogen blocker? Or should I be prepared for cancer to have returned? I cannot identify a specific lump.",
  "A": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your situation and problem. By your history and description, possibility of hormonal imbalance due to tamoxifen is more for your symptoms. Since you had operated breast cancer we should first rule out local recurrence. So better to get done 1.  Mammography 2. PET scan. If both these are normal or negative for cancer then possibility of hormonal imbalance is more. So get done estrogen, progesterone and prolactin levels to rule out any imbalance. Tamoxifen can also aggravate this imbalance if present. So discuss all these with your doctor."
