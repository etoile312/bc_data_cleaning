  "Q": "Hi I have been going to the doctors now for 2 years trying to find answers. I have a lot of pain in my left shoulder blade, under my arm shoulder, and side of breast. Some times it is a stinging burning like it is on fire pain also with numbness. I have had blood work, cat scans, ultrasound, x rays, mammograms, MRI done this pass Monday. Results of MRI is no tears but lots of imflammation. I have a fullness feeling with it under arm and in shoulder blade. I can t get it across to doctor that the shoulder blade is hurting me to the point of not hardly being able to take it. What do you think could be going on.. All I have been given is tramadol 50 mg which doesn t do a thing for it. I also had a cortisone shot in the actual shoulder which helped should a little but didn t nothing for the shoulder blade or under arm and breast pain.",
  "A": "Hello, I have studied your case. MRI may show tear in rotator cuff around shoulder. Medication like methylcobalamine with muscle relaxant and analgesic will reduce pain, you can take them consulting your treating doctor. You may consult physiotherapist for further guidance. He may start IT, or ultrasound which is helpful in your case. You may need to take rest for early healing. Also check your it B12 and it D3 in your blood. If not relieved arthroscopic treatment will help. Hope this answers your query. If you have additional questions or follow-up queries then please do not hesitate in writing to us. I will be happy to answer your queries. Wishing you good health. Take disregards Chat Doctor. "
