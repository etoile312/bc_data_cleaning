  "Q": "I would need an oncologists opinion. I have been diagnosed with breast cancer. Had a lympectomy, and a few nodes taken out, and they had no cancer in a small margin of the tumor (which was very small) and nodes were clear. It is called a negative 3. The oncologist said the best chance of this type of cancer from coming back is chemo and radiation. Which I have had my first but wonder if I am making the right decision. He feel it is the right one for me. Do you think it is.",
  "A": "Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. You have breast cancer with negative nodes.  Modified radical mastectomy with chemotherapy and radiotherapy is the treatment of choice.  You may have triple negative cancer it means you have ER, PR and her 2 new negative.  So hormonal treatment is not effective.  You need chemotherapy and radiotherapy after surgery. Consult your doctor and take treatment accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health."
