  "Q": "I had rib surgery to remove a lump, they took out a small portion front left side just under breast, sorry don t know the rib number the surgery was a year ago. Now I have tenderness below and to the side of where surgery was, not at the sight of the surgery. The area that is painful I can cover with my entire hand it is quite a large area that is tender and if I apply slight pressure it is very painful, I keep looking for a bruise but there is none I never hurt this side. Prior breast cancer on the same side , left breast. What could this pain be from?",
  "A": "As you already had breast cancer on the same side with the removal of the rib, which may be suggestive of involvement of the bone(rib) on same side by the cancer. The pain due to infiltration by malignancy is a continuous type with local tenderness.I need to know the histopathology of your operated breast specimen for bone involvement. Malignant pains should be treated according to WHO ladder based Chat Doctor.  You can also consult palliative care specialist for the same."
