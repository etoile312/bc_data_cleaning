  "Q": "hello, i am 13 years old girl. two of my aunts had breast cancer, one died from it. i have  heard that it can be hereditary, so i have been very concerned. i didnt think anyone my age could get cancer. lately i have been having pains. sometimes i have pains on my legs,arms, and back(they last a few minutes then go away). i also had pains in my breast (mostly the left side). just two weeks ago i notice a small rough dry pacth (looks almost like a scab) on my right breast. i do not know how it got there. i dont know if this make since, but i am really concern if it could be any type of cancer. also i have heard of lymph nodes, and if their swollen it could be infection, virus, or some types of cancer. i dont remember the first time i noticed it, but i have a swollen lymph node on the right side of my ear. i would really appreciate the help thanks!",
  "A": "Hi, Thanks for writing in. About 5% to 10% of breast cancers are thought to be hereditary, caused by abnormal genes passed from parent to child. So you have to get complete disease information from your aunts. Most inherited cases of breast cancer are associated with two abnormal genes: BRCA1 (Breast Cancer gene one) and BRCA2 (Breast Cancer gene two). When these genes contain abnormalities or mutations that are passed from generation to generation, the genes don't function normally and breast cancer risk increases. Abnormal BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes may account for up to 10% of all breast cancers, or 1 out of every 10 cases."
