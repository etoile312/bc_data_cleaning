  "Q": "Thank you. I have been diagnosed with breast cancer . Small, the tumor was taken out, was oridinally DCSI, with a small invasion about the size of a period at the end of a sentence. My surgeon wants to get a node under the arm . I say no because I ve seen far too many problems it presents with removing a node thru surgery. Other than a needle biopsy , or the type of seeing if there is any more cancer, is to do die in the veins and so on? Is there any other way besides these ways to get a node? I DO NOT want a surgery proceedure to remove a node.",
  "A": "Dear there, i respect your concerns but if it is smaller tumor then still I think that you should get a minimal invasive procedure called sentinel node biopsy in which we take out single node after injecting dye to see if it is involved and practically there is no morbidity after this procedure, and it helps to deliver appropriate treatment for your disease.I think you should proceed with this procedure thanks"
