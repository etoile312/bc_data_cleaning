  "A": "Hello. Congratulations on your recent delivery. Couples who rely on breastfeeding to prevent another pregnancy are taking a bit of a chance. Many nursing mothers begin ovulating within two to three months of delivery, while others may not ovulate for a year or more. The problem is, there's no way to predict when you, personally, will become fertile again, so you could actually ovulate, conceive and get pregnant without ever having a period. Thus, if you want to prevent pregnancy you should at least use condoms, and you may want to talk to your doctor about other forms of birth control.\"b\" Now, your breast pain might be a symptom of mastitis, which is a common problem in breastfeeding mothers. Mastitis is caused by a bacterial infection in the milk ducts of your breast, and it can often be managed by simply applying warm packs to the breast. It's okay to continue feeding your baby from both breasts, even if you have mastitis. If your breast tenderness doesn't improve within a couple of days, see your doctor; you might need an antibiotic to get things cleared up. I hope that helps. Enjoy your baby boy!"
