  "Q": "Hi! I am male 28 years old. This what I will explain happened about 2-3 times last year. Everything starts suddenly with single montgomery gland pain (area around the nipple) . and in few days pain gets stronger, and areola thicker. There is small redness on the skin near areola , about 5mm (not every time), It usually last about 5-10 days and dissapears without any lumps (everything looks normal). Now, before 10 days it stared on the right side, and was passed away, and two days ago it started on the left side, identical symptoms. Aureola is kind of inflamated (but just little darker colour) very painful to toutch and visible swelled a little . Area beneath the nipple is not painful just areola, actually about 50 % of areola, not whole in size. Body temperature is 37 C. What my be cause of this ? I did not have any other health issues related so far..",
  "A": "Hi, Pain and redness in the areola of the males can be due to infection, cysts, hormonal changes, fibroadenoma, mastitis, gynecomastia, breast injury (friction with clothes while jogging), runners nipple, diseases involving the testis, hereditary chromosomal trisomy (Klinefelters disease) or male breast cancer.  Get physically examined and get all screening tests done to get treated at the earliest.  In the meantime take Acetaminophen (Tylenol) and apply Calamine lotion for pain relief. Do not scratch or massage.  Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. "
