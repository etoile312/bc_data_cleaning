  "Q": "I am concerned about my sons swollen axillary lymph node. It is 1cm in size, movable, soft but has been there for 2 1/2 months.  The doctor has said there is no need for biopsy, as it is small ,not getting bigger and there are no other prominent nodes. His CBC shows a normal WBC profile but his RBC is microcytic, hypo chromic. His eosinophils are about 10 times normal . He has been given worm medicine and has been on a course of iron therapy for 2 months but the follow up blood work still shows no change. Should the lymph node be biopsied?",
  "A": "Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor, The axillary lymph nodes filter the lymph from the arm, chest wall and breast. It is often difficult to feel normal axillary lymph nodes. Not all enlarged axillary lymph nodes feel the same. Axillary lymph nodes may swell from an injury or infection to the arm or hand. A rare cause of axillary swelling may be breast cancer or lymphoma. I would suggest you to take your son to pediatrician for physical examination and to find out the reason for the palpable axillary lymph node. Thank you."
