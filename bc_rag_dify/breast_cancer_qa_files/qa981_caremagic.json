  "Q": "Double mastectomy followed by 20 weeks chemo and 5 weeks radiation. Did well no big problems. Six weeks after chemo before radiation I started with neuropathy in my feet and hands? Did not have neuropathy during chemo. Any reason I would have post neuropathy ? Put me on a low dose anti depressant and it has helped. Now 4 weeks out of radiation feeling dizzy and headaches daily.",
