  "Q": "Amenorrhea Hi. I am 23 years old,160cm and 48 kg. My last menstrual period was on 24th january and i have always been very regular with my periods. My periods usually last for 4-5 days with a 32 day cycle. This months i had sex around 5 th february. My projected period date is 24th feb but its already past 3 days the projected date. I still havent got my periods. Am having breast tenderness and all the PMS symptoms but am still scared i could be pregnant because i had sex on the 5th that is the first day of the fertikle period. I even did a pregnancy test which turned out to be negative. I am scared because i always have had regular periods.",
  "A": "Hi, Thanks for the query. I understand your concern.  If you have a regular 32 days menstrual cycle. Your estimated ovulation day was(14 days prior to menstrual date. Which would be 26thof FEB. ) 10th of February. That makes your fertile days froth to 13th Feb. (3 days before & 2 days after the ovulation.) as sperms can survive for 3 days after ejaculation & ovum can be viable for at the most 36 hours after ovulation.)  From this science. You don't have pregnancy chance with sex on PTH of Feb. But if you have period ranging from 30-32 days.then yes, you do have a chance of pregnancy.  Pregnancy confirmation can be by- - blood Chat Doctor testing around expected day of menses - Home (urine) pregnancy test after 8 days delay in periods.  - USG scan.after 5 weeks pregnancy.  Delay/ stoppage of periods can be due to Pregnancy/ anxiety, stress/ physical stress, illness/ hormonal imbalance.  Thanks."
