  "Q": "I am 31 have not had my cycle for 7 months & am not sexually active.  I have been having pain in my right breast where 2 doctors found a small lump but a mammogram & ultrasound found nothing.  with the pain in my breast it goes to my arm pit and then down my arm.  I am wondering what this could be related to, could it be hormones or something to do with my lymph nodes?",
  "A": "Hi, Breast pain associated with alteration of monthly periods is suggestive of hormonal balance. For the period issue you need to consult your gynecologist. Small lump at this stage is suggestive of fibroadenomas. If the lump expands rapidly then further investigation is required.Otherwise, a course of vitamin E and oil of evening primrose capsules is all that is required for at least 6 months. Regards"
