  "Q": "My feet and ankles are swollen, I have a swooshing feeling on the left side of my chest under my breast (46yr male) and I am urinating 2-3 times per night. I have palpitations from time to time sometimes very bad for hours at a time. The swelling has been coming and going for about a year. But is not going as much as it used to. What on earth is going on.?",
  "A": "Hey, The swelling below the breast can be a breast lump, or it may be because of some cardiac enlargement. You're also having palpitations, so please get a baseline ECG and echo done to rule out any such thing. Try to get an ECG done at the time of palpitations which is very important. Frequent urination during nighttime can be because of simple urine infection. So first get cardiac workup done and if that is normal than consult a surgeon for the lump and Chat Doctor. Wishing you good health."
