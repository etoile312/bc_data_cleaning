  "Q": "I have a mammogram and they found some microcalcification. Which is like few dusting on my right breast . they suggested me to go for biopsy . I did. The result came out to be negative. Afterwards I started to have diagnostic mamogram. they found some dusting. I did not want to go for biopsy again. i am 49yrs old and going through menopause . So i told them I will go for Diagnostic mamogram about once in 6 months. The biopsy scared me to death. At this point, I think that Dr s just want to make sure and suggest us to go through this .... what do you suggest?",
  "A": "Hello Murrieta, Please ask your radiologist to give a standard BIRDS score for your mammogram. A clustered type of microcalcification is suggestive of breast malignancy. For BIRDS 3, you need a 6monthly mammography follow-up for 2 years and for BIRDS 4, a biopsy is indicated. In your case, a 6 monthly mammogram seems reasonable option, with biopsy needed if there is appearance of any mass lesion, architectural distortion of breast.  I think this standard strategy should resolve your doubts. Keep in touch. Tk care."
