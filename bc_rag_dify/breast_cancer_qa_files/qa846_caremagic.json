  "Q": "I had Breast Cancer. Treatment was a, Zoladex for 4 months then a right breast mastectomy, a course of 5 chemotherapy sessions and the 3 weeks of daily radio therapy. I am now taking Tamoxifin . I am getting a lot of pain in my right side by my stomach under the breast area round to my back. Imentioned it to the consultant at the hospital .they seem to not be bothered about it but , I have had it since I woke up from the operation 18 months ago. What can it be that is causing me so much pain and stopping me from sleeping.",
  "A": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. . Radiotherapy can damage normal structures like skin, nerves etc. besides tumor mass. So it is routine complication of radiotherapy, to have pain at therapy site. It is due to damage to nerves. So start vitamin B 12 and zinc to decrease this pain. Both of these are needed to regenerate nerves and improve nerve function and reduce pain. You can also try Transdermal patch of fentanyl.  This is very good at controlling post radiotherapy pain. Its effect lasts up to 72 hours. So you can try these."
