  "Q": "I m confused. Is there a generic for evista. I m taking evista now after being treated for breast cancer and would love to pay less for the drug. I am now paying $500 for 90 pills. I m seeing references to generic but not manufactured by Lily. Thank you, Gwen",
  "A": "Tamoxifen is generic for vista. It is an oral selective estrogen receptor modulator (TERM) that has estrogenic actions on bone and anti-estrogenic actions on the uterus and breast. It is used in the prevention of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. Raloxifene(vista) was as effective as tamoxifen in reducing the incidence of breast cancer in postmenopausal women at increased risk. A major adverse effect of tamoxifen is uterine cancer;Tamoxifen caused fewer cases of uterine cancer. Tamoxifen increased the risk of cataracts, but tamoxifen did not. Both groups had more blood clots in veins and the lungs, but that side effect was more common with tamoxifen than tamoxifen. On September 14, 2007, the U.S. Food and Chat Doctor. Regards"
