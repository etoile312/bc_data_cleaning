  "Q": "It started about a year back...my work involved travelling with a heavy laptop on my back. This led to severe backache which persists till date. But all of a sudden, I started experiencing pain in my left breast. The pain lasted for a week or so and then I noticed that my left breast had become bigger than my right one..it protrudes more than the right one..i dont know whether it is a sign of breast cancer .. Wanted your opinion",
  "A": "Dear Ma'am, Sorry to hear about your problem, but I am glad that you are seeking medical attention for the same. Breast cancer usually presents as a painful lump in the breast and painful enlargement of the breast is usually not a sign of breast cancer. There might be still be a small chance that this could be something suspicious. To rule that out you should have this problem evaluated by a breast/ general surgeon. Also, you need to have an ultrasound of the breast for better evaluation of the lump. Please feel free to ask any other query or share your USG report.
