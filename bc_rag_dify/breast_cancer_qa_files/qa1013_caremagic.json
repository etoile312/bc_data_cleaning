  "Q": "Hi I am a 32 year old female and my doctor recently found a pea sized lump in both breasts: at 7 oclock on the right and 5 oclock on the left. My gyn has always told me my breasts were fibrocystic, but these are much more defined lumps than ever before. I have had an ultra sound done, whicChatDoctore back inconclusive. I have an appointment with a breast surgeon tomorrow for an evaluation. I am very anxious! So I ve been reading around the message boards trying to ease my mind. Some of the things I read seem to suggest that having one on both sides may indicate something, but it wasn t clear what. My breasts are also sore, but not necessarily near the lumps. I have a child. I have an IUD , which has stopped my menstrual cycle all together for about 5 years. I drink a lot of coffee. My maternal grandmother had breast cancer , but it did not originate there. My mother had a biopsy for a lump and was told it was calcification . Should I be worried? Thanks for your time, Andrea",
  "A": "Hi, you have diagnosed as bilateral fibrotic disease of breast which is periodically related to hormonal influences from the menstrual cycle sometimes. Usually no adverse side effects to this condition, but cancerous tumors may be more difficult to detect in women with fibrotic changes. As you have mentioned your positive family history of breast cancer you at high risk. I suggest you to undergo biopsy to rule out cancer!!!!"
