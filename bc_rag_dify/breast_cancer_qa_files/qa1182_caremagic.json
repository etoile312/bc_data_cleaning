  "Q": "I have a lump inside my buttock quite high up near my back. I had breast cancer 4 years ago and they did say it would be likely to come back in the first 5 years. Could this be it back-or is it a strange place for breast cancer to come back in? The lump is about a 50p and painless. Thanks.",
  "A": "Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. You have history of breast cancer. Chances of metastatic lesion in buttocks are very rare.  It may be lipoma, neurofibroma or some soft tissue tumor or cyst.  You should go for biopsy of that lump to rule out cancer and confirm the exact diagnosis.  Then you should take treatment accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health."
