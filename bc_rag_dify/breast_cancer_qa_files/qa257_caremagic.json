  "Q": "Hi - about 4 months ago i noticed swelling under my right armpit. I went to see my doctor and had mammogram and ultra sound of the area. They found an extremely small lump from the ultra sound. When I press down on the lump it stings (kind of like a bee sting). It gets a little more irritated during my period but outside of that it doesnt bother me. I am 35 years old and there is no history of breast cancer in my family. The doctor told me to come back in 6 months for another ultra sound just to make sure it hasnt grown. The doctor does not believe it is breast cancer...what do you think it can be?",
  "A": "Welcome to Chat Doctor .1. The history suggest that there is a small lump with in the breast (as mentioned in history) and a swelling in the armpit area / axillary region.2.These features suggest a benign lesion on the breast and adjacent lymph nodal enlargement in axillary region.3. Doctor call you after 6 months because - the lesion what he noted during the scan is not coming under criteria of cancer / malignancy.4. In this condition any doctor according to the studies does the same way.5. If there is any difference in lesion - growth - then an FNAC - fine needle aspiration cytology to evaluate the cells.6. Further treatment will depend on the findings. Good luck. Hope it helps you. Wish you a good health. Anything to ask ? Do not hesitate. Thank you."
