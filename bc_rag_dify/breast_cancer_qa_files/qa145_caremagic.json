  "Q": "I just had my first radiation treatment yesterday and shortly after I developed breast pain, breast bone pain and am developing a respitory problem (feel like Im getting sick).  The machine is the newer Tomotherapy machine and not supposed to interfere with my lung.  What could the problem be??",
  "A": "I am very sorry to hear that you have these symptoms. Newer CT machines will not cause many side effects. However, there is a slight possibility of radiation induced pneumonitis. If that happens it will happen after at least 2-3 weeks post radiation. The pain in your breast and Breastbone are because of direct effect of radiation causing inflammation. And your feeling sick because that is from radiation fatigue(which is normal). If you think you're not able to carry out daily activities, and bed bound because of this you should ask your radiation oncologist to decrease the dose of radiation or give treatment holidays. I hope this answered your question and I wish you a speedy recovery. :)"
