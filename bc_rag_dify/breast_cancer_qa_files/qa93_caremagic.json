  "Q": "I just ended my period last week on Friday & i heard a squirt/pop noise, ran to the restroom and there was blood. I ve been avoiding the doctor because for the past month I ve had a lump under my armpit close to my breast. Could these 2 things be connected in any way?",
  "A": "Hi, Thanks for asking. Based on your query, my opinion is as follows.1. Possible urinary tract infection could have caused blood in urine. Get a urine examination for confirmation. Later culture and sensitivity would be needed for appropriate treatment.2. Lump under armpit would be usually a lymph node swelling or a glandular swelling of sweat glands. FNAC is necessary for confirmation.3. Both are not related. Make sure your breast examination is normal. Meet your doctor for clinical examination of breast, and urine, FNAC tests and antibiotics. Not to worry. Hope it helps. Any further queries, happy to help again."
