  "Q": "I just recently had my left nipple with a slight burning sensation. I can feel a small bump under it and it is hurts if I press hard on it. Just from looking at my breast there is not visual change. I am 33 years old and have no children. Should I be very worried about being cancer?",
  "A": "Hi, Dear,Thanks for the query from you to my Chat Doctor Clinic. I have gone through your query and appreciate your concerns of it. After in-depth study on it, In My opinion-the painful bump under left-nipple, mostly is-intraductal papilloma with cystic inflammation, and or/ could be- fibroadenomas of lump are benign in nature, underneath the nipple. Treatment-Though both the possibilities are of benign nature, timely Excision Biopsy would reduce any chances of breast cancer later on. Mammogarm and PET scan-guided Biopsy would fix the diagnosis and would relieve you of the worry of cancer. Hope this would resolve your worrisome query for now. Wellcome-to my Chat Doctor Clinic for any more query."
