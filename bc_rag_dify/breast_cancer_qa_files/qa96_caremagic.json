  "Q": "Age: 22, Weight: 127 Height: 5 8.5 history: MTHFR genetic defect, asthma family history: grandparents with breast cancer and prostate cancer , dad: high blood pressure. I have always had an irregular period, and cannot use hormones for birth control. Because I am getting married in two weeks, I got a copper IUD inserted two weeks ago, and I am bleeding like crazy. The heavy bleeding started two days ago. I put in a super tampon, and within an hour I had bled through my pants and I am passing larger than quarter sized blood clots, sometimes two at a time. I am afraid that I might be losing too much blood. I am also bloated and cramping, but I know these are regular symptoms. I don t want to have to take out the IUD and find another method of birth control that isn t a hormone in just two weeks because I don t want anything to go wrong with negative side effects on the honeymoon. Is there something I can do?",
  "A": "Hi, Thanks for the query. While being on IUD, some amount of menstrual irregularity is common. But as you are having excessive bleeding, better to consult gynecologist once. With her advice take anti - fibrinolytic Chat Doctor.  Then you can go for additional hormonal pills for few days, to regularize the cycles. No need to remove IUD during this period. After stopping the pills you can continue with IUD. Take care."
