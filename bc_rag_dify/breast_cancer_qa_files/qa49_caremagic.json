  "Q": "My friend had a partial mastectomy 13 years ago and the scar has suddenly started weeping and bleeding. She says she might have scratched it in her sleep but she is afraid to go to her GP in case it is bad news. What could cause bleeding so long after the operation?",
  "A": "Hi thanks for contacting Chat Doctor... Noted your friend having bleeding from scar of mastectomy... Here consultation to surgeon done without delay to prevent further complication. Here breast must be examined by palpation for detecting any mass... If mastectomy in past done for malignancy then there can be development of malignancy from residual tumor cell. If mass palpable FNAC done.... If palpation normal then bleed may from scar that might hypertrophy ... If scar is seeming to be infected then antibiotic needed... Brufen like anti-inflammatory Chat Doctor. . Take care."
