  "Q": "i have a 4months old baby. last night i had sex with my husband and the condom got busted. i expect my period on the 23rd of january (which is in a few days). however i just purchased gynaecosid tablets, do i go ahead and take them? what are the side effects?",
  "A": "Hi.I've gone through your query and I can understand your anxiety. If there is history of unprotected sex during the period of breastfeeding, there are high chances of pregnancy. To avoid it, you can safely go ahead with hormonal methods of contraception either as birth control pills or implants or IRENA. As you have taken gynaecosid pill, It's safe to use during breastfeeding & it won't cause any harm to the baby. But can expect common side effects of birth control pills like Nausea, vomiting, headache, breast tenderness, abdominal bloating, swelling of the ankles, weight gain, irregular periods etc. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Take care.  "
