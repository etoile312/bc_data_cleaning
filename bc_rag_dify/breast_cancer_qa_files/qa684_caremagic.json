  "Q": "I am at present having chemo treatment and taking Tamoxifen for metastatic liver cancer following breast cancer ten years ago.    My breast cancer lump tested oestrogen positive.    I take glucosomine for arthritis and am wondering if it is safe to take a tablet with chondroitin sulphate included in with the glucosomine?    Will the chondroitin interfere with the Tamoxifen which is being used as an oestrogen blocker?",
