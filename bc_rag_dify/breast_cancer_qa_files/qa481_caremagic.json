  "Q": "I have this red bump on my left breast for a month or two now. And it look like it gonna scar and it felt as if they was something in it. Well just a little bit ago I pop the scab. And a redish pink puss and blood came out. Im not sure what it could possible be. Is it cancer ?",
  "A": "Hello! Thank you for the query. As it is in the breast area, cancer needs to be ruled out at first. Please note that there is a special breast caner type, called inflammatory cancer. It acts like an inflammation, however it does not heal by itself. That is why I suggest you to do not wait any longer with it. Please consult a surgeon or gynecologist as soon as possible. Breast ultrasound should be done. Hope this will help. Regards."
