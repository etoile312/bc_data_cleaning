  "Q": "I have breast cancer (had chemo, surgery and radiation) on my left side and am currently having one chemo drug for a year (Her 2 gene). In the last two months I have noticed that my left clavicle bone below my neck is bigger and feels very different. No pain, but concerning. I see my oncologist next week, but she has said in the past that the radiation might have caused inflammation, but I am still concerned. She also said that most people have one collar bone bigger than the other, and I am left handed, but the end of it feels really different.",
  "A": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. Since you are breast cancer survival, we need to investigate your collar bone enlargement thoroughly. Breast cancer is known to metastasize to bones. So cancer spread to collar bone must be rule out first. Another possibility is enlarged subcuticular lymph node due to cancer spread. This can also give feeling of enlarged collar bone. So better to get done ultrasound examination of local part to rule out all these. If this is normal then no need to worry much. Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health. Thanks."
