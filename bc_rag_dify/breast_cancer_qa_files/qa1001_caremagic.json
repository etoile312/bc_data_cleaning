  "Q": "i have been undergoing fertility treatments, and I am now in the two week wait. I had an Ovridrel shot on the 15th, and starting on the 23rd, I have been running a very low grade fever (99.1 to 99.8) continuously. Could this be because of the Ovridrelm, or could this be an early sign of pregnancy?",
  "A": "Hi, Thanks for writing to Chat Doctor. Low grade fever is not a common side effect of OSI Chat Doctor.  Common side effects are abdominal discomfort, pain, nausea, vomiting , breast pain. Low grade fever is not an early sign of pregnancy too. Early symptoms of pregnancy include fatigue, vomiting, nausea, increased urination, breast enlargement or pain.Don't loose hope you can be pregnant without these symptoms. I would suggest you to consult your doctor for your fever as it could be because of other diseases. Hope I have been helpful. Regards "
