  "A": "Hello, You may have swelling in the bladder or uterus or kidney. Sometimes you may suspect kidney stone, also in that blood in and white blood cell appears so when the stone comes down from kidney to bladder through the ureter. You may have radiating pain in the backside of the rib cage. You need to consult a urologist and get a sonography done to confirm the diagnosis. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Hemang S Jane"
