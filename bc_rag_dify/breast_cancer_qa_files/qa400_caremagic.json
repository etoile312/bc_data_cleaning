  "Q": "Hi, I have a 3.5 x 3 x 2.7 cm posterior subserosal fibroid. I am 34 and only recently started trying for children. This news is really distressing for me as I am wondering if it will hinder pregnancy. Should I have it removed before continuing to try to get pregnant? Also how long has it taken to grow to this size? Thanks",
  "A": "Hi, Thanks for the query. Usually posterior subaerial fibroid may not affect the chances of pregnancy. But it can grow during pregnancy and can lead to complications like red degeneration, difficulty in labor, increasing the chances of surgical procedures etc. So, better to get treated for the fibroid before planning for pregnancy. The exact time taken for the fibroid to grow cannot be told as that can differ from person to person and depends on hormonal levels. Treatment options of fibroid depends on size, symptoms etc. Consult local gynecologist once and take her opinion. You can go for hormonal pills for few months, that can decrease the size of the fibroid. If fibroid is not decreasing or increases in size, you may need surgical procedure. Mastectomy can be done either by laparoscopic method or by laparotomy. After the recovery with your doctors' advice you can plan for pregnancy. Take care."
