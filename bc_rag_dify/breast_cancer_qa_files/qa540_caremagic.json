  "Q": "Hello, I m wondering if I could be pregnant. I m on the birth control pill, and have never missed it or had unprotected sex. However I am having a lot of pregnancy symptoms, and my body feels different recently. I had my last period, but it was very different to normal, it would normally last 5-6 days and I would bleed heavily every day, but this time it only lasted 3 days with very little blood. My symtoms are increased urination, tiredness, nausea, breast tenderness, more prominent veins on breasts and light cramps in lower stomach and back. Please help!",
  "A": "HI, I understand your concern.  It's common with some oral contraceptive pills . To cause side effects having symptoms like yours (specially progestin only pills-Mini pills)/ If you are very regular in taking your contraceptive pills & did not have unprotected sex . I do not see any chance of pregnancy in your case. Please do not worry. Continue with your pills regularly, it will adjust automatically. TO avoid any stress/ anxiety. You can repeat pregnancy test after 15 days. When you find that too -ve, you would be convinced.  Thanks."
