  "Q": "I am undergoing testing for breast cancer. On 01-27-14 the doctor removed my nipple, areola and some tissue under the skin. The results showed cancer. Another surgery on 03-10-14 resulted in removal of lymph nodes and a lumpectomy and removal of additional tissue. The surgeon thinks it is early stage 2. I saw an oncologist today, and we are planning a Pet-scan. She said I have lobular breast cancer. I also discovered a small lump on my left breast, and 2 different colleagues concurred that there was a lump. Depending on the outcome, maybe mastectomies on bone breasts followed by chemotherapy. A lot to take in one sitting.",
  "A": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. Lobular carcinoma of breast is notorious to spread in opposite breast. So better to get done biopsy from left breast lump too, to rule out malignancy. And yes PET scan is needed to rule out distal metastases. As bones are the most common site to metastases. In early stage 2 breast cancer treatment of choice is unblock resection of bread tissue with resection of involved lymph nodes.Post-operative chemotherapy and radiotherapy is necessary if lymph node s are positive for malignant spread. Also get done ER (Estrogen Receptor) and PR (Progesterone Receptor) study to guide hormone therapy (tamoxifen). So discuss all these with oncologist."
