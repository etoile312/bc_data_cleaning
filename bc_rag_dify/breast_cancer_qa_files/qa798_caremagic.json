  "Q": "Hy,I choose egg donation program (my results from amhormon was bellow 0.8)soo  I dont have eggs any more.... But I have the disease of tuberous sclerosis diagnosis how safe is for me to have a pregnancy? I dont have sypmtoms....how ever I was diagnosed 3yrs ago.......(also history of breast cancer 7 yrs ago )Im 39 yrs old.",
  "A": "Tuberous sclerosis is recognized to show wide variability of expression. There are only four cases of tuberous sclerosis in pregnancy in the literature. Two of these had favorable maternal and fetal outcomes and the remaining two presented with serious maternal and fetal complications. These included acute intra-abdominal bleeding due to a ruptured renal tumor, which led to renal failure requiring hemodialysis, and severe preeclampsia with pathologically enlarged kidneys noted at the time of cesarean section. Renal involvement appears to be the single most important prognostic factor in pregnancies with tuberous sclerosis. Renal evaluation should be performed in any patient who presents for preconceptions counseling. Past history of breast cancer is not a contraindication to pregnancy as long as you are in the all clear now. Take care."
