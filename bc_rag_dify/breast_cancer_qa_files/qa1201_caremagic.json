  "A": "Hello, It is not recommended that you continue to take tetracycline if you wish to become pregnant. A short course of topical medications such as benzoyl peroxide or yeti NBIC acid gel is recommended. There are certain other blood tests such as complete blood count, It B12 levels, Ferritin levels, Antinuclear antibody, TSH that can help understand why you are losing hair. Please stop taking antibiotics if you wish to get pregnant. Best Wishes."
