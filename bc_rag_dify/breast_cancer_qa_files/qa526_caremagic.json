Where should I go for further treatment?Can I delay the excision of  the tissue(lump)  for a month or 15 days or I should go for treatment immediately.",
  "A": "Hi.based from your clinical presentation, I would suggest a repeat core needle biopsy of your left breast lesion (possibly mammography-guided, to not miss on the lesion). If available, you could also opt for a mammoth biopsy if there is in your area. I am suggesting this since your FNA smears and your BIRDS categorization does not coincide together. If the results turned out to be positive, a formal mastectomy should be done. This, you have to discuss with your surgeon for different surgical options. Prior to the procedure you'll undergo different ancillary tests for clearance. Consultation and treatment should be done accordingly and as soon as possible. The earlier we catch breast cancer/problems now, the better prognosis/outcome you'll have. Hope this helps.~ Chat Doctor. "
