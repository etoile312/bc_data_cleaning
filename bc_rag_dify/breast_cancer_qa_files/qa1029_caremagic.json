  "Q": "I have a diagnosis  (9/6/13) of infiltrating carcinoma with lobular features, Grade II and associated microcalcifications.  Left breast, ultrasound guided biopsy at 12 oclock 1-2 cm from nipple (solid palpable mass 1.5 x 1.0 x 1.1 cm).  Estrogen Receptor: positive in infiltrating tumor cells (percentage + intensity score = 8).I am 73 years old, generally in good health.I am exploring options of total mastectomy or lumpectomy but do not want the recommended radiation.  I plan to follow the Hippocrates Health Institute raw-foods, no-sugar, no dairy, no meat program.  How quickly do I need to make a decision and schedule surgery?  what does Grade-II mean?  Do I at least have the sentinel lymph node(s) removed and biopsied?  How important are the lymph nodes to my own immune system response in fighting cancer cells, especially if I build my immune system with the Hippocrates program?",
  "A": "Hello Susanne, You may be surprised to read my answer. I am a Homeopath attempting to help you. You have said that 9/6/13 is the date on which you got the diagnosis. I wish to know what exactly happened in your personal life just before the onset of the breast node and for how long it is there. If it had its onset sudden, then there was a shocking psychological conflict just prior to the development of the breast node. If the node was there for a longer period, you had an adverse life situation to which you reacted badly and gradually developed into a worse situation. No cancer is created in your body to kill you. It is a reaction of the body to protect you from still worse situations. So first you recite to your mind that this is not to kill you but to save you. In short, I can say that when your immunity got poor, you became sick. When you say that you are healthy, you did not say anything about your mind. In conventional method of treatment, this mind aspect is not considered as important in the production of the cancer. But as a Homeopath of 35 years of professional experience I can confidently say that Mind is the most important factor producing such cancers. Therefore, my advice to you is to find an expert Homeopath at the earliest or get back to me personally with your details. I can even send to you a case receiving format in which you can enter your developed case and forward it to me. Please do not go for any surgery-neither lumpectomy nor total. Even if you go for surgery, continue with a healthy mind and Homeopathic treatment. A good counselor can also help you during these processes. You can go for the Hippocrates program. With best wishes, Chat Doctor.  J. VargheseHomoeopath"
