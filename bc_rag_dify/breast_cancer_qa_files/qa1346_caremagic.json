  "Q": "Hi,My mother is suffering from breast cancer. She has been diagnosed yesterday and the report states like this:Smears shows scattered as well as in groups pleomorphic epithelial cells. The cells have coarse chromatin,prominent nucleoli and variable amount of cytoplasm. This is a report of FNAC.",
  "A": "Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. Your mother has breast cancer. She should go for mammography and biopsy and PET scan. Then she should take treatment according to stage and spread. Modified radical mastectomy followed by chemotherapy is the treatment of choice. If her ER, PR and Her2 new receptors are positive then she can take hormone therapy. Consult your doctor and take treatment accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have any doubts then contact me at bit.ly/ Chat Doctor. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health."
