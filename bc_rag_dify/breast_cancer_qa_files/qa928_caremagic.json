  "Q": "I have a grandaughter with a breast little larger then the other one and there is a hard spot when you touch it. she says it hurts if you rub it or touch it. shes only 10 do I need to be concerned. Physical Doctor at urgent care gave her aniboitic and told her mom it should go away within 2 weeks. As a grandmother you hear all this about cancer. Should I suggest something else?",
  "A": "Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. She may have acute or chronic mastitis or abscess formation.  Don't worry about breast cancer at age of 10.  Chance of breast cancer at age of ten is almost negligible.  Just wait for few days.  If it clears then it's ok.  If it remains persists then go for further investigation.  Don't worry much about that. Just be relaxed. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health."
