  "Q": "I have breast cancer and have just completed my taxotere and carboplatin chemo and will continue on Herceptin until April.  I just now noticed the skin on my vagina and groin area has turned almost black.  I am 73 and also incontinent so wear Poise pads and occasionally use Depends Silouette panties (in case this might be caused by the fabric in those).  No itching or discharge or enlarged lymph nodes or pain.  Just the skin color change.  I have no idea how long the skin color has been this dark.  I weigh 174 and my belly does hang down somewhat so I dont really see this area looking down and just noticed it in the mirror.  My Pet/CT scan in April was clean.  I have another one due in a month.  Of course I am scared to death this is cancer-related.",
  "A": "Hi, It seems that you had developed Post inflammatory Hyper- pigmentation at the thigh area which left the black marks. It is a common condition mainly seen in a bit overweight persons. Do not apply any home remedies which can aggravate the situation. You can apply creams such as Atelier acid, glycolic acid and comic acid can be used to reduce the pigmentation over the groin area under dermatological supervision. Do not apply anything near vaginal area as it can irritate the soft skin over this area."
