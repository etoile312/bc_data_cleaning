  "Q": "I m a 38 yr old woman...I was diagnosed with insite 2 breast cancer it was highly recommended to have a bilateral mastectomy which I had done as far as treatment I m on tomaxafin for 5 yrs prior to that I had a partial hysterectomy due to polyps on my uterus and heavy bleeding. It s been 3 yrs now and I ve been noticing a brownish discharge from my vagina, What can it be?",
  "A": "Dear, It is unfortunate that your both breasts are removed on prophylactic basis. You were in premenopausal group of patients in whom the cancers are supposed to be aggressive because of the active hormonal status. Hormonal status of yours is not completely suppressed by tamoxifen and persisting estrogen activity does cause the discharge from the vagina. In the long run second malignancy from uterus is expected after long therapy of tamoxifen. Hence, it is recommended that you should visit a gynecologist to get pelvic examination to rule out the development of new polyps and pap smear examination done to see that your brownish vaginal discharge is normal. This could be a normal physiological process."
