  "Q": "pain is like heartburn but in a small area in left breast, not all time, sometimes happens when I drink liquid, and sometimes when I dont (I tend to drink hot boiled water frequently throughout the day) There is no lump in the breast, just this occasional heartburn like sensation inside the breast in a small spot. The sensation is approximately halfway between the cleavage and the nipple (but one inch higher than the level of the nipple). The sensation area is about a one inch circle in size",
  "A": "Hello dear, thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your situation and problem. In my opinion you are having HERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) mostly. But since you have left sided chest pain, better to rule out cardiac cause first. So get done ECG. If ECG is normal then no need to worry much for cardiac cause. Breast related cause is also less likely as you are not having breast lump. You are having mostly HERD. It is due to laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Because of this the acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause the symptoms of heart burn. So better to follow these steps for symptomatic relief. 1. Avoid hot and spicy food. 2. Avoid stress and tension. 3. Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals. 4. Start Proton pump inhibitors. 5. Go for walk after meals. 6. Keep 2 - 3 pillows under head in bed."
