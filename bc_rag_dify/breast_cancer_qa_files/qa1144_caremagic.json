Immature granulocytes are 0.04 with metamyelocytes,myeovytes and promyelocytes. WBC is in the high normal range at 10.2.My doctor is out of town and can t speak with me for over week.Thank you,Jude",
  "A": "Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. Your red cell distribution width indicates variation in size of RBC. It is normal. No need to worry about that. Your WBC count is at high normal range with few premature cells.  You may have some infection.  You should take a course of antibiotics a d repeat your total WBC count after a week. Consult your doctor and take treatment accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health."
