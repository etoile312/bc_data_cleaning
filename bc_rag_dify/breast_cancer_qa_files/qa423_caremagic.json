  "A": "Hi, Possible causes for pain in both armpits are swollen lymph nodes, fatigue, folliculitis, neuropathy, pleuritic pain or breast pain. Until further examination is done, it is difficult to say what it is. Check for cardiac pain or fibromyalgia also. Use tablet Pregabalin once daily for five days. Use tablet Attract twice a day for five days. If symptoms don't improve, please consult your doctor. He will examine and treat you accordingly. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further."
