  "Q": "Hello Dr. Samuel,Today is the 3rd year anniversary of my hysterectomy as well as the removal of my left ovary.  I have been trying my best to stay healthy, but despite my best efforts, it has been really a struggle to keep my stress levels down since I also take care of my little boy who has special needs.  I had been having a lot of discomfort on my right side and it was discovered last November that my right ovary has also developed a cyst.  My primary physician Rx vit. D3 as well as some iodine and the ultrasound shows that it is not cancerous, but recently I have been experiencing a lot of pain once again.  I guess my question is:  If I have to have this last remaining ovary removed, will this force me into premature menopause?  And if yes, will taking hormones be risky for my heart?  I currently see a cardiologist for an enlarged heart due to high blood pressure.  Thank you so much for your time.",
  "A": "Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor. Just a simple cyst in left ovary usually does cause a severe pain abdomen. Please repeat an ultrasound abdomen. Cyst in ovary may cause severe pain if it undergoes torsion. If nothing found then do an MRI abdomen. Right side abdominal pain may be due to Appendicitis, colitis, Internal Hernia, etc. Now you have only right ovary left. If this is also removed, definitely it may cause premature menopause. Because removal of both ovaries may result in depletion of estrogen and progesterone.Thus, Hormone replacement therapy becomes essential to decrease the side effects of depletion of hormones. Earlier it was thought that HRT increases the heart attack, deep vein thrombosis and stroke. But now if it is concluded that HRT significantly reduces the risk of mortality, heart failure, or heart attack, without any apparent increase of breast cancer, deep vein thrombosis or stroke. So better consult cardiologist and taking HRT is essential before removal of your right ovary. Hope this Helps. Take care. Chat Doctor. "
