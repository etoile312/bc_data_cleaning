  "Q": "I have had stabbing pains mainly on the left side of my chest but also on my right and on the central upper part of my chest.  They come in waves.  I have had them for more than a month now, and I feel they are getting more painful.  I am a female 68 y old.  Just had a \"fine\" mammogram",
  "A": "Hi. I can understand your concern. If the chest pain is disturbing your routine activity then get a chest x-ray done to rule out any lung infection, or it could be just a muscle pull. Do not lift heavy weights. Ideally ECG and 2d echo should be done first in your case. If both are normal than no need to worry about heart diseases. HERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) can cause similar kind of chest pain. HERD is due to laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Because of this the acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause central chest pain and nausea. Avoid stress and tension. Avoid hot and spicy food. Avoid junk food. Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals. Quit smoking and alcohol if you have these habits. Go for walk after meals. Keep 2-3 pillows under head in the bed to prevent reflux. Lose weight if you are obeseDont worry, you will be alright. Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health. Thanks."
