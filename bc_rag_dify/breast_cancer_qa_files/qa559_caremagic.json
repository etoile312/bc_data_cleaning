  "A": "HI, Dear,Thanks for your query to Chat Doctor virtual Clinic. I studied your query in all the details put forth by you. I understood your health concerns. Your inverted lump with swelling underneath, is an-abberation by birth of the Nipple with abnormal but hormonal pubertal breast swelling in male child as you are in pubertal age.Don't worry mostly the report will be normal, for the breast lumpectomy tissue. So don't worry until you get the report. Hope this would help you to relieve worries and plan further treatment as fast as possible with your doctorxxxxx"
