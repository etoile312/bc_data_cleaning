  "Q": "itchy red bumps hard in middle with outer red halo in random places all over my body except face and arms i am worried because had breast cancer 3 years ago and had chemo and radio therapy could it be bed bugs cant see any and I am very hygenic my husband rcently had ring worm but these spots are very different from what he had",
  "A": "Hi and welcome to Chat Doctor. Thanks for the query. This doesn't sound to me like bed bugs and this is more likely some allergic reaction or some dermatologist disease, so you should rule out these 2 first. It can be allergic reaction to some cosmetics or soap so try to find what exactly is irritating your skin. I don't think this is related to your cancer disease or chemo and radio unless this was recently done. Wish you good health. Regards"
