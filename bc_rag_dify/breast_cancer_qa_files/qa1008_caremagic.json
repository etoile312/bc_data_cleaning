  "Q": "A friend of mine called to tell me she has a red ring around the areola and its very painful.  She went to a surgen and was told it a rare form of Breast Cancer and they want to remove her breast in 2 weeks - Ive been on line and cannot find out anything about this - its seems very drastic.  please advise",
  "A": "Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. Red areola with painful tumor is seen in inflammatory carcinoma of breast. However, it can be something else.  You should go for mammography and biopsy of that lump.  It will give you exact diagnosis. Then you should take treatment accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health."
