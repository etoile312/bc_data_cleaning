  "A": "Hi, Dear,Thanks for the query to Chat Doctor. I studied your problem in depth and I understood your concerns. Cause for lump in armpit with tender breasts-In my opinion you seem to have Menstrual Enlargement of the Breast in Axillary Tail, which are with Stenosis of the Breast. This is non-malignant condition but needs observation by self breast examination.Hence, stop worrying about it, as it is not a CANCER as you fear and think, but do check it up from ER Gynec-Surgeon. For Final Diagnosis and treatment needs clinical data from a Doctor. And Hence for further treatment I would advise you to Consult ER Gynec-Surgeon, who would treat it accordingly. This advice is based on the facts from the history you give and needs further clinical check.Hence, I would advise you to check with ER Gynec-Surgeon. So don't build up wrong concepts and create more psychic complications in you which would increase risks and costs to you. Hope this would relieve your problem. Welcome for any more query in this regard to Chat Doctor. Write good resume and Click thanks if you feel satisfied with my advice. Have a Good Day. Chat Doctor. N."
