Is it breast cancer?",
  "A": "Hi Pankaj thanks for your question Male breast cancer is a well known entity. Relax. Breast cancer involves one breast .and is usually painless unless it is in advanced stage.swelling which you had at the age of 14 was mastitis (inflammation of breast) which usually occur in male at the time of puberty due to various hormonal changes and remain persistent for some years. What you are having this time is continuation of same process. So most probably you're having mastitis. Which is remain untreated will get settled of its own. Get yourself examined by a doctor to differentiate between mastitis and breast cancer. Hope I answered your question."
