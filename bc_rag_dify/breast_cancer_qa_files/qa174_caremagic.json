  "Q": "My heart beat makes my body move. It s like a slight pull to the left with every beat. I usually only notice this when I have to be very still. The first time was about 5 years ago during a mammogram. Another time at the ophthalmologist for a test to measure pressure within the eye. But now it is most anytime when I am quiet and still. The beat makes my upper clothing move and is very visible. I m 67, female.",
  "A": "Hello! Welcome on Ask a Doctor! I understand your concern and would explain that your symptoms could be related to a cardiac arrhythmia. For this reason, I recommend consulting with your GP for a physical exam and some tests: - a resting ECG-complete blood count for anemia-blood electrolytes for possible imbalances-thyroid hormone levels for thyroid gland dysfunction- an ambulatory 24-48 hours ECG monitoring for possible cardiac arrhythmia. You should discuss with your doctor on the above tests. I remain at your disposal for any further questions whenever you need! Hope to have been helpful! Wishing all the best, "
