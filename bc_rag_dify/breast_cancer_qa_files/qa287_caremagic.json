  "Q": "hi dr. I am a woman of 53. I had once a blood pressure of 230/120. I was hospitalised . now I am fine however. I went for a bone density and mammogram and it was picked up something on lung. possibly due to my scoliosis. I was told to get a chest xray. please tell me what does it mean when it says left ventricular configuration to the heart and mild unfolding of the aorta. thank you",
  "A": "Mam left ventricular configuration, means the border if formed by left ventricle which may be normal or mildly enlarged and unfolding of aorta is old term suggesting the mediastinum is mildly enlarged, as I am not a radiologist, I will stick to clinical relevance which will be helpful to you.  As you suggested your BP was on a high side It's likely there will be some thickening of your heart muscle, which we call concentric LVH. I will assure you its normal and you shouldn't worry about the same.  However, if available just to confirm what I suspect based on short history you have mentioned, do get a 2d echocardiography if available.  Regards Chat Doctor. "
