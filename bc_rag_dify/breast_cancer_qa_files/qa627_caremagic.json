  "Q": "Hi, just finished my third round of chemo for breast cancer. Caught early stage but hi recurrence score. This past week, have had very painful hemorrohoids and abdominal pain, back pain, hearburn. Are these related to treatment? Did a round of flucanozole anitfungal after first round of treatment due to thrush and fungal infection. Could the problems I have now be related to fungal infection? Doc wrote me a 2nd script for the antifungal in case I needed it. Should I use that or go back? Have had other complications too.",
  "A": "Problems mentioned now are not related to fungal infection. Though chemo courses may manifest sucChatDoctorplications sometimes. You have the option to get herbal Ayurvedic to correct these problems better irrespective of chemo. Your doctor has given II course of fungal saying if need be. You may skip it. Pl find some Ayurveda doctor to ad Chat Doctor.  Back pain may be treated externally if there is no disc problem...that may bean aged by Lumbosacral support. Hope it helps."
