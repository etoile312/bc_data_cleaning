  "Q": "Im a male age 35.  This morning I felt a sore lump under my right aereola.  It feels like a firm nodule but it moves a little if I try to push it in different directions.  Still it feels like its attached under the nipple and the pain feels like when you have a pimple or cyst but its deep inside behind the nipple.",
  "A": "Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. You have lump behind nipple with soreness.  You may have some benign cyst, proliferative breast disease or breast cancer.  Furthermore, you should go for mammography and biopsy of that lump.  It will give you exact diagnosis.  Then you should take treatment accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health."
