  "Q": "I had suspicious breast tissue biopsy and will hear results today. They found irregular persistent density in the 9 o clock region of the left breast. Focused sonographic examination of this area reveals a hypoechoic structure taller than wide and measuring 1.2 x 0.9 x 0.8 cm. Are these usually cancer?",
  "A": "Hi, Thanks for writing in. Focused breast ultrasound helps to determine characteristics of doubtful lesions in the breast. As described above, there is a dark area as seen on ultrasound at the 9 O clock position. This is marginally taller than wider if we take measurements as 1.2 x 0.9 x 0.8 cm. In some research studies, it has been found that 74 to 80 percent breast lesions which were taller are malignant. This way breast biopsy is the best confirmation, and you have already got it done. By appearance, I will say that please do not worry as the lesion is slightly taller than wider, and we can still hope for a benign finding. The final result is by biopsy. Please do not worry."
