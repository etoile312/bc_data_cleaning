  "Q": "I was diagnosed with a cyst in the left breast 2 years ago. I have recently had a mammogram and ultrasound. the new radiologist does not think this is a cyst and wants me to have a needle aspiration biopsy to check for cancer. I am getting a second opinion and having another ultrasound done first. A cyst cannot turn cancerous right??",
  "A": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. Breast cysts are usually benign in nature. But can turn into malignancy in the future.  Though the chances are very less, but possibility can not be denied. That's why follow-up mammography is always indicated for early detection of cancer. So new radiologist might find something unusual in cyst appearance, so he orders needle aspiration to rule out early malignancy. So in my opinion you should get done Needle Aspiration to rule out malignancy."
