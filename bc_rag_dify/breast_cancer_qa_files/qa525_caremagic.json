  "A": "Hello, and I hope I can help you today. If you have been having unprotected sex and not using contraception and your period is late, there is a possibility you could be pregnant. The Detail test is not a very accurate method of checking for pregnancy.  Furthermore, pregnancy symptoms vary widely between women, and some of the same symptoms (like bloating and breast tenderness) can be caused by PMS as well as pregnancy. So the most accurate way to determine if you are pregnant is to do a urine pregnancy test, which can be purchased at a pharmacy or chemist without a doctors prescription.  The over-the-counter pregnancy test is as accurate as one in the doctor's office, and looks specifically for the presence of the pregnancy hormone in your urine. Many women can miss a period from weight changes, traveling or change in your daily schedule, and stress, among other hormonal factors.  Even worrying about being pregnant can sometimes make you skip a cycle. So in summary, the interpretation of the Detail test can be quite variable, so I recommend proceeding with a urine pregnancy test to confirm your diagnosis. I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. Best wishes,"
