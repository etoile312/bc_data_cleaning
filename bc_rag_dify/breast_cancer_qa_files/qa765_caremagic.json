  "Q": "I was found to have a 17 cm x 12 cm x 10 cm ovarian tumor during an ultrasound on Tuesday. I just got my CA-125 test results today which read a 334. Can endrometriosis (which I have had my entire life) cause a reading this high? I am 60 yrs old, healthy, no pain, no other symptoms and all other blood tests and PAP test cam back normal. I have two CT scans scheduled for the am. I am worried sic but praying this tumor is benign. Any thoughts on the CA125 test results?",
  "A": "Hi.CA 125 is elevated not only in Ovarian cancers but also in other cancers like endometrial cancer, fallopian tub cancer, breast cancer etc. It is also raised in Non-cancerous conditions like Endometriosis, several diseases of the ovary like Ovarian cyst etc. As per literature, only 3% of females with raised CA125 levels have Ovarian cancer. But, you should be further evaluated. Hope the Swelling in the Ovary is a benign one, not cancerous. All the best. I can follow if you post the CT reports too. Take care."
