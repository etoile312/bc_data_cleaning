  "Q": "My husband gave me big hickeys for two days near my nipple on my left breast...few days after i notuced the bruisy soreness was reducing but i felt a lump near the nipple about an inch wide. The lump is also noticible n the surface n feels thick inside. Cud i hav breast cancer?",
  "A": "Hello! Welcome to Chat Doctor. This seems to be more likely a hematoma. Hematoma is nothing but clotted blood under the skin. Nothing needs to be done as it resorts spontaneously. Serratiopeptidase like enzymes can be taken to make the resorption faster. Watch for infection, which is suggested by presence of fever, pus discharge from nipple. In this case incision & Chat Doctor. If there is suspicion of malignancy (cancer) on clinical examination (unlikely in your case), I advise FNAC - fine needle aspiration cytology for confirmation of diagnosis. Hope this helps. Wish you speedy recovery. Thanks. Regards."
