  "A": "Hi welcome to Chat Doctor forum.  Thanks for asking a question to Chat Doctor. F.  Your mother had cerebral atrophy, and unbearable ear pain due to infection of the internal ear.  Your mother is under the treatment of a neurologist for cerebral atrophy. It is a permanent change with no way for complete relief. And she is using medicines for maintenance.  Now she has got ear pain due to infection of the internal ear. That is to be treated completely.  So I advise you to consult an E.N.T.surgeon for diagnosis and treatment. He will give treatment for medical treatment, if no relief he may propose mastectomy, with advise of the neurologist. There is a possibility of complete relief.  Wishing for a quick and complete recovery.  Best regards."
