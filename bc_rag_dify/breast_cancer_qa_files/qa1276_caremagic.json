Could I still be pregnant.desperate for an answer",
  "A": "Hi, I think if you have missed your periods you can be pregnant. Get a urine pregnancy test done. If it is positive, then you are pregnant and should consult a doctor. If it is negative, you have to take some medicines for your periods to come. You can try for ovulation induction with natural trying for 3 to 6 months if you are not pregnant. Talk to your doctor about this. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. "
