  "Q": "Hi. I have been having pain at my right upper abdomen about 15 minutes or so after eating. The pain is up high, like right under my rib cage. It is happening just about every time I eat, and more so if I eat a regular to heavy meal. It is painful for a while but then goes away. Sometimes it hurts a lot. I thought perhaps I have an intestinal problem like a blockage or something. Other things going on with me lately which may not have anything to do with my upper abdominal pain are...Shortness of breathChest pain/right breast painPossible acid reflux disease, mild",
  "A": "Hi ! Good evening. I am Chat Doctor answering your query. Considering all the points in your history, even though this may be a simple case of hyperacidity or acid reflux disease, if I were your treating physician, I would have advised you for a thorough cardiac check up in relation to your shortness of breath and chest pain. This will include an ECG, and a stress echo if need be. If the cardiac angle is excluded, then I would have prescribed a proton pump inhibitor with a prokinetic agent and a probiotic for you. This will probably will relieve your symptom. Apart from this, some changes in your lifestyle will also be advised, like more of roughage and plenty of liquids in your diet, avoiding fatty, fried,and fast food. A daily routine exercise depending on your medical capacity will also help in relieving your symptom. Also, I would advise you to raise the head end of your bed, so that regurgitation will be controlled. After all these efforts if the condition persists, then I would advise you for an ultrasound abdomen, and an upper GI endoscopy for further management. I hope this information will help you in deciding on the further course of action. Thank you for using Chat Doctor for your health information. Good luck."
