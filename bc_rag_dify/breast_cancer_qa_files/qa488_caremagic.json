  "Q": "Clomid - 3 days late , brown discharge on wiping- Pregnant? I have irregular cycles and have been consulting a practitioner to chart out my fertility/ ovulation times in order to conceive. I have been put on Clomid. It has been 3 cycles with a one month break in between, but no conception has occured. With clomid this time, i was supposed to have a 30 day cycle, but I am about 3 days late. I have been getting some (not all) symptoms - back pain , headaches and sour taste in the mouth. Also, past two days I have noticed a light brown discharge, which is a little more dark today, but is seen only when I insert my finger . I have taken 2 tests, one as recent as yesterday, which has been negative. what should I do? Is this implantation bleeding?",
  "A": "Hello;welcome to Chat Doctor Even the normal periods can get delayed from 1 day to a week, so you need to wait at least till a week and then get a pregnancy test done to get a better idea. The symptoms of pregnancy will be nausea;vomiting;breast tenderness;back pain;sick feeling etc. So please wait for a week the repeat the test with morning sample of urine and if that is negative and even then you do not get your periods then consult your doctor. Thanks"
