  "A": "Hi, Dear,Thanks for the query to Chat Doctor App.I have gone through your query. In my opinion there are remote chances of coughing, which may indicate complications of Tamoxifen. Consult your chemo-doctor. I would advise urgent basis-Chest X-ray would resolve any new issue cropping up tamoxifen-pulmonary thromboembolic complications and any metastatic growth with breast cancer. In this scenario-I would stop the Tamoxifen-unless the risk of the complication of tamoxifen or resistance to tamoxifen is ruled out. Thnks. Wellcome again."
