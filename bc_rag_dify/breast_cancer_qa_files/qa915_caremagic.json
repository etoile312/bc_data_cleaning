  "Q": "i am a 20 year old female and there is a lump on the underside of my left breast, it started to swell, and i was feeling it and it popped and quite a bit of blood came out, it looks like 2 light flesh color bumps and a swollen vein.. there has been a lump for a few weeks, but now it is swollen and hurts quite a bit..",
  "A": "Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. You may have some benign cyst, fibrotic disease with inflammation, abscess forming infection or other mass.  Chances of breast cancer are very rare at your age.  So nothing to worry about that. You should go for fine needle aspiration cytology. It will give you exact diagnosis. Then you should take treatment accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health."
