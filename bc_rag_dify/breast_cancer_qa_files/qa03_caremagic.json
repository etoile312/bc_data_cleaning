  "Q": "I have just had breast cancer surgery 9 days ago. the margins are clear, but it was estrogen/progesterone positive. They want to do chemo and radiation, but I feel there has to be a better approach in treating this. I work for a naturopath, but his specialty is not chemo or radiation, but would like someone who will work with him in my care.",
  "A": "Hi, Thanks for writing in. Cancer is a difficult condition to treat and treatment differs in every patient depending on the location, size, staging and post surgery biopsy findings. Since you have had surgery only 9 days ago, it will help to discuss with your oncologist and depending on the biopsy report, go for a comprehensive treatment. Even is the margins are clear, there is estrogen/ progesterone positive nature and this requires you to have chemotherapy and radiation. The earliest this is started the best outcome it will have. I wish you reconsider the benefits of chemotherapy and radiation in your case and start treatment on time. Naturopathy can give you comfort and detoxify your system, and it is best to discuss your treating doctor on when to take simple naturopathy procedures and wait until you are done with initial chemotherapy. Even if the margins are clear, there can still be persisting microscopic invasion of cells and this can lead to flaring of cancer an few months. Radiation is precise and specific to the region of cancer. Please do not worry."
