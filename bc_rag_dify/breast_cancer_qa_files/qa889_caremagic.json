  "Q": "I stopped breast feeding over 1 yr ago, but still have a lump. I went to my dentist to have a tooth removed and he said he would not extract my tooth with out approval from my GYN... I m in the Philippines and I think the Dentist is way behind the modern world.. Is he right? I m afraid to have a biopsy as complications from such surgery happen way to often here. Sincerely, MM",
  "A": "Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query. It is advisable to get an opinion if you have any family history of breast cancer. If it is a small lump, it goes in favor of benign lesions like lipoma or fibrous. Nothing to be panic, Consult a good oral maxillofacial surgeon and explain your problem, he will examine and give a right suggestion whether to consult a gynecologist or you can go ahead with extraction. No need to go for biopsy, you can get an ultrasound or FNAC done to confirm the diagnosis. I hope my answer will help you, take care."
