  "A": "Welcome to Chat Doctor. I understand your concern. You might be suffering from viral infection.I would adv you to do a blood test mammogram to see the total leukocyte count. If it is raised >10000/CMM then it is a bacterial infection and would need antibiotic like septum.Otherwise, viral cold infection resolves on its own. Adv-1. Steam inhalation2. Adequate rest.3. Plenty of oral fluids4. Salt water gargles.5. Medications like minaret and Monte LC can help. In case of worsening of symptoms refer to a general physician immediately, as swine flu has to be ruled out. Take care."
