  "Q": "Yesterday I just discovered a lump on my left armpit but I m not sure if it is a lump? And this morning my breasts were itchy and it was hurting but the pain was not so much. Since last week my underarms have been itching and I m really worried if it s some type of breast cancer. I told my mom about it but she said I was just overreacting.",
  "A": "Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. You may have enlarged axillary lymph node due to reactive hyperplasia or soft tissue tumor like lipoma or some axillary tail of breast.  You should go for examination of axillary region and breast.  If needed go for biopsy or fine needle aspiration cytology. It will give you exact diagnosis. Then you should take treatment accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health."
