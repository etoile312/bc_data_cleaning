  "Q": "I m on Tamoxifen for estrogen receptor breast cancer treatment . However, due to risks of side affects I prefer to take something herbal. What can I take that will not cause me to produce more estrogen. I need something anti-estrogen. I would like to get off the tamoxifen. I ve been on it for 3 mths. I was using a progesterone PMS cream, but when I got a yeast infection, I stopped using the progesterone cream . Is it safe to use the cream w/my BC diagnosis?",
  "A": "Dear Ma'am, Sorry to hear about your condition. Tamoxifen does have a few side effects, but the benefits far outweigh the risks associated with the Chat Doctor.  It cuts down the risk of cancer occurring again by almost 50%. The only precautions you have to take with tamoxifen is to get a regular PAP smears and bone density checks done. Herbal medications can be useful sometimes but in this case numerous studies have proven tamoxifen to be beneficial. There is no harm in using progesterone creams with your breast cancer diagnosis."
