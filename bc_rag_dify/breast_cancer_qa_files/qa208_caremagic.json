Now there is. Bubble like spot there and it is starting to hurt really bad. This happened about an hour ago. I have a lot of antibiotics here I do not want to go back to dr",
  "A": "Hi.it is best if you consult with a doctor, preferably a breast or a general surgeon, for clinical evaluation. Based from your description, it could be an inflammatory reaction or a mastitis. It could also be a cyst, a fibrous or a fibroadenoma which are all benign breast lesions. Other tumor lesions such as malignancy must also be ruled-out. Diagnostics such as breast ultrasound and a possible tissue biopsy may also be recommended. Management (medical and/or surgical) will be directed accordingly. Hope this helps. Good day!!~ Chat Doctor. "
