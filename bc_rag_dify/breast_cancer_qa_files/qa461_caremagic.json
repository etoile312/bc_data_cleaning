  "Q": "I am a cancer survivor.  I had a hysterectomy 6 years ago. Precancer cells removed back in March and I see my ongologist every 4 months.  I began taking new vitamins...Shaklee Vitalizer Gold.  I have a friend who was interested in them as I feel great since I started taking them.  My energy level has greatly improved.  My friend who was just treated for breast cancer told me that her doctor told her to stay away from soy.  These new vitamins that I am just loving...have soybean oil and soy lecithin in it.  I googled it and I see mixed reviews on whether I can take this or not.  My distributor from shaklee who also is a good friend of mine told me that I can take these vitamins and that she is going to provide me the information regarding this.  Im just curious of your thoughts on soybean oil in vitamins if I previously had cervical cancer.",
  "A": "Hi, I have read your query. Soya oil is good for health but not in every case.since it increase risk of breast cancer in some people be cautioned to use it i.e. don't use it without discussing your doctor .even thought direct link has not been proved about soda and cervical cancer, but you still be careful to use it .never ever ask or follow your friend for you health always take advice of doctor ....I hove you have understood my point I want to tell you .than"
