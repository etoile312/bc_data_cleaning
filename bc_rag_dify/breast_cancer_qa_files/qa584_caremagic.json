  "Q": "one inch bruise slightly above right hip bone - at least a week (I normally take aspirin following DVTs and two PIs, but have laid off three days to reduce bleeding) and recently had leg ulcer, only just cleared. No known bang to where the bruise is, though some weeks ago I banged the other (left) side in fall. Age 74. (Father died of leukemia and other causes, sister died of breast cancer). Could this indicate blood disorder, should I resume aspirin - your advice welcomed.",
  "A": "Hi. Please donor worry over this being cancer. It is highly unlikely to be that given the picture you have portrayed. It is more likely due to the aspirin that you have been taking. Furthermore, it is quite common in patients on aspirin to have increased browsability following trivial trauma. The trauma need not be substantial for bruising to occur. Stopping aspirin for a few days does not help and is not advisable with your history. Just take painkillers if there is pain (Tab Paracetamol 500Â mg SOS) and keep having a look at it daily. If it doesn't decrease or increases over a week, consult a surgeon."
