  "A": "Hi ! Good evening. I am Chat Doctor answering your query. Although from the history it seems like an inflammatory mass due to some kind of infection, if I were your doctor, I would advise for a broad spectrum antibiotic along with an anti-inflammatory and a proton pump inhibitor. At the same time I will do a total work up for the lesion like clinical examination, a mammogram, an FNAC (fine needle cytology) if need be, and a blood sugar estimation as a routine. Rest of the management would depend on the clinical examination finding and reports of the investigations. I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem. Please do not hesitate to ask in case of any further doubts. Thanks for choosing Chat Doctor to clear doubts on your health problems. Wishing you an early recovery. Chat Doctor."
