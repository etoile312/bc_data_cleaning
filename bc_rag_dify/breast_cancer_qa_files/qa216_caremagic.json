  "Q": "For some time now Ive been getting chest discomfort, tightness, like burning and itching quite frequent almost like bad indigestion. Also when I lay on my side, mostly left i get a tight crushing feeling that builds up in the middle between my breast and I need to turn back over on my back or sit up. First the doctor thought it was acid reflux and prescribed tablets for this. But, ultimately the sensations didn t really subside and have come back. My doctor took an ecg, said it was normal but that my blood pressure was up. He also examined my breasts because i have had tenderness, soreness and discomfort in my breasts. He said everything felt as it should, no lumps, nothing to indicate breast cancer. He diagnosed that I had hyperkinetic circulation which i have not heard of before. He took blood tests which i will get results for on Monday and prescribed me beta blockers, atenolol actavis 25mg. Ive not taken them before and feel a little nervous to do so? Along with this, I get tension headaches (pressure like a clamp), tight shoulders and neck, also a crunching, popping sensations when I move my neck and head (don t know if it is related). would like an opinion, advice. thanks toni",
  "A": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. In my opinion, you are mostly having stress and anxiety related symptoms. Stress and Anxiety are the biggest risk factors for acid reflux and tension headaches. So we should first treat your stress and anxiety. So consult psychiatrist and get done counselling sessions. Try to identify stressor in your life and start working on its solution. You may need anxiolytic Chat Doctor.  And beta blockers are known to reduce anxiety, so no harm in taking it. For your chest symptoms, along with antacids, you need to follow these lifestyle modifications. 1. Avoid hot and spicy food. Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals. 2. Keep 2 - 3 pillows under head in the bed to prevent reflux. 3. Lose weight if you are obese. 4. Quit smoking and alcohol if you have these habits. Don't worry, you will be alright. Avoid stress and tension, be relaxed and calm. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks."
