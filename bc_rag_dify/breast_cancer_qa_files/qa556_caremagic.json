  "Q": "the left side of my jaw/mouth is in pain, i dont know if its to do with a toothache, my actual jaw, muscle or an ear infection. i cannot open my mouth wide or close it to the full without pain occuring. Ive tried cracking my jaw, force a yawn, popping my ears and eating food and had no success.",
  "A": "Hi, Thanks for consulting Chat Doctor Read your query, as you have pain in jaw, popping of ears don't worry this can be due to carious tooth, impacted tooth, or due to temporomandibular disorder. For this I will suggest you to consult dentist and go for oral examination and examination of Temporomandibular joint for pain and tenderness of mastectomy muscles. In meantime do warm saline gargle, avoid excessive mouth opening, take soft diet, do hot fermentation. Hope it will help you. Wishing you good health. Regards, "
