  "A": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. You are diagnosed case of breast and lung cancer. Biopsy in lung cancer can cause pneumothorax. And this might be the cause for you breathlessness. Other possible causes of breathlessness in lung cancer patient are 1. Bronchitis 2. Malignant Pleural effusion 3. Pneumonia 4. Enlargement of underlying mass lesion. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system, chest x-ray and PFT (pulmonary function test) first the diagnosis of these causes. You may need antibiotic, inhaled bronchodilator and inhaled corticosteroids. Usual time for recovery after starting appropriate treatment is 1-2 months. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks."
