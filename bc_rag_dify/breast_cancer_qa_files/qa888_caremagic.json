  "A": "Hello, Elevated BP doesn't indicate breast cancer. Since she has lymph nodes removed on left side, there may be swelling and hardening of the left limb which may lead to falsely high BP, that's why It is avoided in that limb. Still you can just if there is any swelling of the right limb or any lumps in right maxilla or breast. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. "
