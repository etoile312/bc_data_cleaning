  "Q": "I had surgery on my hand yesterday. Today I have red rash on my face and throat and tingling in my lips. I have taken 3 OxyContin since yesterday at 1 pm. Do you think this is a reaction to the anesthesia or the oxy? The same thing happened to me 2 months ago after I had a breast biopsy (that was negative thankfully)",
  "A": "Flushing and rashes can happen after the use of opiate medications.  The medications given to you for anesthesia may have included an opiate as well, so it is difficult to determine what would be to blame for your symptoms.  I would recommend stopping the Oxycontin and see if Tylenol and ibuprofen alone would keep your pain under good enough control. For future procedures, you could consider asking for a different pain medication for your recovery period that could include a different opiate to see if you can tolerate it without developing a rash."
