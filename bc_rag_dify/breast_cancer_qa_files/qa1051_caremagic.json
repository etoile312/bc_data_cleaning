  "A": "Hello, Your ultrasonic report for cancer is negative which is a good thing. Looking at your details the present knots can be due to fibrotic breast disease. This is also dependent on hormonal variation in females. At present for relief you may have preparation of primes oil, at least two times a day. If after 10-15 days it still does not resolve then you may discuss biopsy from your doctor. Hope I have answered your question. Let me know if I can assist you further. "
