  "Q": "Hello, My name is Denise Gold. I was wondering what could be wrong with me. I am 16 years old, I m 123 pounds, breast cancer and diabetes run in my family, I m mildly active ( I walk about 2-3 miles about 3-4 times a week, medium pace). About 4-5 weeks ago I was 134 pounds, but now I m only 123.. I m not an expert, but I m sure 11 pounds lost in 4-5 weeks isn t okay. I eat the same as I ever did, so it couldn t be change in diet . Also, my gums have been really weak lately. They never would bleed for me when I would brush my teeth , but now when I brush my teeth i can spit out dark blood, and at random times they would just start bleeding . I brush my teeth on a regular bases, my Mom s a health freak. Another thing is I ve been extremely hungry lately, more than I usually ever am, but when I eat I feel sick. I don t think it would be pregnancy because I just got a really heavy period, mind you it was a whole week early and only lasted 2 days (my normal periods are usually ALWAYS the same time or very close to the same time every month, never a week off, and they would always last a minimum of 4 days. Also, my breasts have been getting really sharp pains at least a few times a day, especially in my left one near the midline of my body. Another thing is, I swear I ve been so mean lately, naturally I can be mean sometimes, but never like this. I just feel like it s something I can t control. Another thing, I m in a career tech. school and I m going for allied health. Well, my class was practicing vital signs and my teacher was demonstrating on me with the radial pulse . She pointed out that my pulse was extremely slow for my age. Also, I ve been having a lot of bowel movements for the past couple weeks, more than I usually do.",
  "A": "Hi. From your history I understand that you are quite obese and have been having weight loss, with recent onset of bleeding gums and a low pulse rate. I'm not sure on how low did you mean your pulse rate is, though I guess if you do not have any fainting attacks or chest discomfort due to this, you need not worry. Weight loss despite normal diet, may be an indication of the onset of diabetes, or may be due to thyroid dysfunction which may also have abnormal bowel movements. Bleeding gums can not be tied up with these two conditions, though bleeding gums is a very common problem. It could be that your gums are unhealthy with infection, or you have scurvy, or you have some other condition associated with weight loss which can be picked up after a detailed evaluation of you and your blood counts. So please consult a physician for the same. Thank you."
