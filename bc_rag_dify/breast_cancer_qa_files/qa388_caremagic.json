  "A": "Hi.it is best if you consult with a doctor, preferably a breast or a general surgeon, for clinical evaluation. Based from your description, it could be mastitis or a breast inflammation secondary to breastfeeding. It could also be due to a cyst, a fibrous or a fibroadenoma which are all benign breast lesions. Other tumor lesions such as malignancy must also be ruled-out. Diagnostics such as breast ultrasound and a possible tissue biopsy may also be recommended. Management (medical and/or surgical) will be directed accordingly. Hope this helps. Good day!!~ Chat Doctor. "
