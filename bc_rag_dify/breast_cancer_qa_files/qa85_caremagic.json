  "Q": "I am a 35yr old female. recently I went in for a scope to see why I have acid reflux, I ended up getting a second scope and a colonoscopy. They found a 2 inch polyp that was not cancer, but said it couldnt be any closer. It was also sent off to get a second opinion that I am waiting on. I also have had a tumor on my ovaries from endometriosis and had them removed 2 years ago. I was advised to get a mammogram asap. Im really starting to freak out. I want to know if I can get chemo treatments to just get rid of everything even though I dont have cancer",
  "A": "Hi, Thanks for writing in. Chemotherapy is given only in the presence of existing or pre-existent cancer in the body. It cannot be used as a general treatment to eradicate all cancer cells even before they occur. These chemotherapy medicines are strong and focused to work against rapidly multiplying and proliferating cancer cells containing altered cell nuclear material. As you have a 2-inch polyp, it will be best to get it operated and sent for biopsy. This will pick up even the slightest abnormal cells and then a chemotherapy might be recommended. In the absence of such features, giving a chemotherapy is not justified. You can also get serum cancer markers to know if you still have risk of any specific group of cancers and then become vigilant and get detailed testing done. Please do not worry."
