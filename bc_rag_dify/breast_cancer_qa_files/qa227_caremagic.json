  "A": "Hi, The itchy rashes on arms, axillae, trunk and thighs may be lichen ultimatum or purity. There may be some cause. It may be some irritant, allergen,infection anywhere in body or some internal disease. You consult dermatologist. Have investigations to find out systemic cause. You may consult physician, if internal problem is suspected. If some irritant or alleged is found, it may be removed or prevented. You may take antihistamines like levocetirizine or desloratidine till itch is relieved. Systemic steroids may be taken in tampering doses, if needed. Mild steroid cream may be applied on the affected parts. You might feel better. I hope you got my answer. Thanks."
