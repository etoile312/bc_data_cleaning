  "Q": "I am a 43 yo female 5 7 165lbs, I am in perimenopause no serious health issues except for breast density and cysts in either breast that come and go since i was 38. Ive had a mammo/sono every year since then I ve had BIRADS OF 1, 2 and 3 in the past..my last mammo was November..BIRADS 2...3 months ago I found something like a nodule under my Left armpit, its moveable and hard to the touch my guess is its about 1 1/2 to 2 cm, 2 months ago my gyno wanted me to see a surgeon and have it removed but i figured it would go away..last month i was doing my exam and discovered those same nodules but smaller and grouped between 1 and 2 o clock on the upper outer quadrant of my left breast, should I ask for another mammo or is it my hormones?",
  "A": "Hi, thanks for writing to Chat Doctor. Yes, it is all related to your hormones and no need to ask for another ammo!these nodules/nodular hardness, pain, cysts or any whitish nipple discharge, vague lump are all related to hormonal influence and correlates well with BIRADS1/2/3. Better to stick to medical management and avoid surgery in these cases as surgery doesn't treat the actual cause! If still worries you may go for an FNAC test for confirmation of fibroadenomas or fibrotic disease... Hope this answers your question. If you have additional questions or follow-up questions then please do not hesitate in writing to us. I will be happy to answer your questions. Wishing you good health."
