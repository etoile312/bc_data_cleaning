  "Q": "Thank You for your time. I just received my CT report without contrast . Im concerned because I just finished  Breast surgery March 7th. I had reconstruction. I feel great but my Ct  report stated right lobe has irregular shape and appearance is worrisome for mass. I showed my oncologist and she took a series of blood tests for my liver and they were all in range.The ALT,Alkaline Phosphates , AST CA15-3, and CEA were all perfect and in the normal range. Are blood test reliable to ascertain or  to diagnose Liver disease?",
  "A": "Thank you for posting query.I have gone through your history. Yes liver enzyme tests is a reliable source to determine liver functions. Since you blood test are normal and your experience NO symptoms, so Observation is required only, i advice you to repeat the CT scan after 3 to 6 months. Hope the lesion size is regressing or lesion is disappeared.in case, if the size of lesion (mass) is increasing as compared to previous CT scan, then visit a hepatologist. Any further questions are welcomed. Hope to answer your concern. Health professionals aim to diagnose properly and manage patients according to their limited knowledge. Cure is blessed by the ONE who Created us, whose power and knowledge is unlimited .wish you good health. Regards, Chat Doctor. "
