  "Q": "I have a chickpea sized lump on right breast with a thick cord attached. The cord travels down breast into top of rib cage. Had mammo and ultrasound. Will see surgeon soon, but in meantime, could this be a non-malignant condition? Ive never had cancer.",
  "A": "I would like to know your age? And whether anyone of your relatives (maternal side preferably) had breast cancer or ovarian cancer.?? Or whether u have had ovarian mass too...?? So get a pelvis Ultrasound done too. Yes obviously it could be a Non-malignant condition like for example fibroadenomas.but I can comment on that only after knowing the above details and if you can tell me the Ammo & Ultrasound reports."
