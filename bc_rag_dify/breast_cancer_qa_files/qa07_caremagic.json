  "Q": "my mother has been in the hospital for 16 days, they first said she has breast cancer, then they said Lymphoma, then they said Non Hodgkins Lymphoma, now saying she has Leukemia - they keep saying they are 95% sure but then come back and say they were wrong, do you have any suggestions for me as to what to do from here?  We are in Richmond, Virginialisa",
  "A": "Dear, First we need to have full history and examination of the body report. Then a blood picture with peripheral smear examination to arrive at some provisional diagnosis. If she has a lump or swelling on any part of the body a fine needle aspiration biopsy report. This will definitely give a diagnosis. I think your primary physician will definitely do what is necessary to arrive at final conclusion. The different diagnosis conveyed to you must be provisional on the basis of simple general physical examination. Lymphoma, Hodgkin's or non Hodgkin or leukemia is confirmed only by biopsy. Truly,"
