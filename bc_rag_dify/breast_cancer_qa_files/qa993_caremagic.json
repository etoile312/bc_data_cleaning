  "Q": "My mother age of 67 having breast cancer. Surgery has been done. Doctors started Chemo but due to weakness she is unable to tolerate the medicine. My mom is having depression last many years. Now after chemo they are very much disturbed. Is there any option of chemo. Kindly suggest",
  "A": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your situation and problem. Chemotherapy i s very toxic to the body and has many side effects. It actually acts on cell division. So along with cancer cells, normal healthy cells of the body are also damaged. So general well-being of patient is Disturbed. It also causes gastritis, low immunity, skin palliation etc. Because of this oral intake of the patient is decreased. So patient feels low energy and weakness. And sorry to say, but there is no alternative to chemotherapy. Radiotherapy is more toxic than chemotherapy. Better to start palliative treatment in the form of high protein diet, multivitamins and other supportive care like pain management."
