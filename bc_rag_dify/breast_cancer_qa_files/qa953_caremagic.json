  "Q": "I have a bump on my areola and when I squeezed it it bled and pussed out a little. I am pregnant but have been pregnant before so I know what lactating looks like. It is big, but not overly. It is sore now that I popped it, but not overly. Any ideas?",
  "A": "Hello! Thank you for the query. Such bump in the aureole area is most likely a sign of inflammation. Pregnancy and breastfeeding increases the risk of breast inflammation. In some cases what looks like a breast inflammation, can be an inflammatory breast cancer. That is why you should not ignore it. Please consult a gynecologist. Ultrasound should be done and in case of any doubts, biopsy. Hope this will help. Regards."
