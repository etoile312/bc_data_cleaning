  "Q": "I am 26 yrs old, I wiegh about 123 pounds and I am 53. I have had pain and discomfort in my right breast for over 2 months. There is a lump there that I can feel and it is a little grey where the lump is. My right breast is now slightly larger then my left and sometimes my nipple hurts and itches. A heating pad will relieve the pain temporarily and then it comes back. Some days are easier to deal with then others. I did have a benign tumor when I was younger in 2001. It was removed along with two others they diddnt see on the sonagram. Is this just another episode of what I have experianced in the past or is this different? To touch my right breast is a little painful.",
  "A": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your situation and problem. In my opinion you should consult doctor and get done 1. Clinical examination of breast 2. Mammography of breast. Possibility of recurrence of fibroadenoma is more. But since you are having pain and slight color change of overlying skin, possibility of breast abscess (bacterial infection) or early breast malignancy should also be evaluated. So better to get done mammography and biopsy if needed for the diagnosis of breast swelling. Don't worry, you will be alright."
