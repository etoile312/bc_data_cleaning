  "Q": "I have chronic sinusitis and have been prescribed betamethasone nasal drops and have been taking them for a few weeks. I have started to experience relatively frequent cramps - in my arches radiating up my calves at night, in my diaphragm, and in my chest post mastectomy/ recon side. I wondered if the 2 things are related?",
  "A": "Hello, THX to contact us. I understand your concern and respond to your query. If I am your treating doctor I advise you that steroid treatment won't cause you any symptoms as you have mentioned and its to not on short duration of treatment of two weeks. Steroid is actually a pain relieving. The thing you have mentioned is unrelated to your sinusitis. If you have anything else to ask, kindly contact me. Wish you a very good health at Chat Doctor. Chat Doctor. Infectious Disease."
