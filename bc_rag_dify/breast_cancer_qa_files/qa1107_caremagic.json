  "A": "As per dictum in medical practice, any lump in the breast is cancer unless proven otherwise. Worrying too much will not help you. The best thing is to know what it is. There are few tests, to tell you whether it is cancer or not. Digital bilateral mammogram, FNAC(needle test) will tell us what it is in most of the time. So the first thing is to visit surgeon. Let the tests follow and afterwards follow what your doctor tells. It depends on this test results.Don't worry and tense up. These tests are necessary to give correct information about your lump and afterwards gives good relief and also sleep."
