  "A": "Hi, You need to get evaluated for the cause of anemia. The both of your symptoms may be due to one reason or different. Take oral iron tablets every day and one deforming agent now and one after 15 days, get done complete mammogram once. Itchy skin with tiny boils that leave tiny whitish marks may be due to many conditions. Kindly upload a photo of the lesion which may assist us to diagnose it. For now with your doctor advice take a course of antibiotic (like Amoxicillin + Clavulanic acid) and apply the same ointment (Unibet). Use only washed and sun Chat Doctor.  These may help you.Wish you good health. Regards"
