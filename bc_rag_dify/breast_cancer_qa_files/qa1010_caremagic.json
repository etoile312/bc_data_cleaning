  "Q": "My husband has moderate to severe pain under his left shoulder a little towards the right. This has been going on for approximately 3 months. It is some what swollen and is also tender to the touch. Motrin 800 takes the edge off the pain, cold compresses do not help but heat seems to give him some relief. He has seen a physician and was given muscle relaxers and narcotic pain medication that really just puts him to sleep. He also has taken steroids which did seem to help him. It is also important to note that on December 5, 2014 he was diagnosed with breast cancer in his right breast and is scheduled for surgery this Thursday 1/22/15. Pet scan, CT scan, MRI, Ultrasound have all been negative for any cancer in the area where he is experiencing the pain in his back. What are your thoughts? Y. Williams",
  "A": "Hi, Thanks for writing in. If not the cancer then it is probable that he is having pinching on nerves taking place along the nerve pathway. The nerves take origin from roots at the spine. Then the nerves travel through exiting nerve root foramina and take the formation of brachial plexus which proceeds to supply the skin, muscles and joints. It is possible that a nerve entrapment is occurring at some place and the pain is felt at the shoulder. Cancer is less likely the cause of this pain. Please do not worry."
