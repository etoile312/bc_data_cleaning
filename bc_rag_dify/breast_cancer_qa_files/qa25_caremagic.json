  "Q": "I have very lumpy breasts a doctor checked said it was just muscle but I still worry it is cancer had a mammogram two yrs ago all clear but one breast seems to ache a lot and is bigger it is making me ill can t go back to doctor he will call me a hypochondriac",
  "A": "Hi dear thanks for the query on ChatDoctorusually one breast will be slightly larger than other. If the disparity is noticeable and if painful it needs to be ad Chat Doctor. If your age is between 20 and 40 years you need to get ultrasound breast to check for fibroadenomas. If fibroadenomas you have to take vitamin E tablets daily one and prim rose oil tablets once daily for one month these may help with the pain thank you"
