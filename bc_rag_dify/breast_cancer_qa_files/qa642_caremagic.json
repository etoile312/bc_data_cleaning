  "Q": "I just started the neuvaring this month, but before starting it me and my boyfriend had unprotected sex. I did use plan B the next morning but I took out the ring a week ago and I still havent started my period... I am also have some pregnancy symptoms. What do you think?",
  "A": "Hi dear, I have gone through your question and understand your concerns. Delay in the periods can be due to pregnancy or due to the effect of the emergency contraceptive pill you have taken, as it is known to delay the next expected periods by 2-3 weeks. I suggest you to get a urine pregnancy test done, if negative then you can safely wait for the periods for another2-3 weeks. Hope you found the answer helpful. Wishing you good health. Chat Doctor. "
