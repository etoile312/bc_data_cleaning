  "Q": "i am 46 with a history of endometriosis and was just diagnosed with andomysis.  the opposite of endometoiosos.  i have found a lump in my right breast a little closer to my arm pit but not under it and it has been hurting since.  off and on.  my right breast also has shooting pain in it once in awhile and feels hot sometimes.  i just had a mamo and an ultrasound and they said it was dense breast tissue.  i am scared of cancer.  can you help",
  "A": "Hello It appears from your complaints and the ultrasound that you are probably not having any serious problem. You have not made a mention on the size of the mass, mobility, consistency. If the lesion is small, mobile, soft, then you need not bother much as it is just a benign lesion. Keep a watch on the lesion, if you feel there is a sudden increase in the size or if it gets fixed to the underlying tissue or there is bloody discharge from nipple or retraction of nipple, then you need to consult a doctor to evaluate the nature of lesion. Most of the lesions of breast which are cancerous or precancerous are picked on an ultrasound or mammogram. However, if you are still in doubt then it could be clarified on FNAC(fine needle aspiration).  Hope I have answered your query. Regards."
