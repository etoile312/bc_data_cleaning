  "A": "Hello misunderstand your concern. Chance of being pregnant is very less as you did intercourse in safe period. Chance of pregnancy is high in 5 days before and after your ovulation day (Ovulation: 14th day of cycle).Also, you had taken emergency contraceptive pills, if you had taken within 72 hours of sex, chance of pregnancy is only 5 bleeding is due to pill as it cause with Chat Doctor. It remains 4-7 days due to hormonal imbalance. Also note other side effects:It will remain for 4-5 daysNausea or vomitingDizzinessFatigueHeadacheBreast tendernessBleeding between periods or heavier menstrual bleedingLower abdominal pain or cramps I think it is being side effect of pills."
