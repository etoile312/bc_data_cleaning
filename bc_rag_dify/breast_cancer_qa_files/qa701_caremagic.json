  "Q": "Hi, Im a 27 year old female. Im experiencing pain and burning in the left auxiliary area. 4 years ago I had a mammogram and ultra sound to check for cancer.. They didnt find anything.. The lump is still there and it is getting very painful. I do have a family history of breast cancer.. What should I do? If its not cancer can I have the lump removed surgically? Thanks..",
  "A": "Hi.it is best if you consult with a doctor, preferably a general surgeon to do medical and physical examination. It might just be an axillary lymphadenopathy secondary to a recent infection, like an upper respiratory tract infection. It could also be other benign lesions such as hi Chat Doctor.  To rule out if it is related to a breast condition, it is best to initially have a breast ultrasound as a diagnostic evaluation. A tissue diagnosis or a biopsy will be done accordingly. Hope this helps. Good day!!~"
