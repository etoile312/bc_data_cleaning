  "Q": "Today I had some light pink vaginal discharge. I ve never had that before. Before my periods I just get light bleeding in clear discharge. This was kinda thick and pink. My periods are irregular and I use a diaphragm or condoms when having sex. I ve only ever been with my husband. Does that sound like a sign a of pregnancy?",
  "A": "Hello, and I hope I can help you today.First, if you have been using contraception (even a barrier method) every time you have sex, your chance of pregnancy is extremely low no matter what your symptoms are. Secondly, having occasional abnormal vaginal discharge is more likely a symptom of a vaginal infection than pregnancy.  Slight bleeding can be caused if the vaginal canal is very irritated, and if your discharge is thick, there is a possibility you may have a vaginal yeast infection that is causing inflammation in the vagina. Pregnancy symptoms vary widely between women, but the most common sign of pregnancy is missing your period.  Nausea, fatigue, bloating, breast tenderness and mood changes are some other symptoms that are commonly associated with pregnancy, however all these can also be caused by irregular hormone production. So if your period is not late, I strongly believe that your symptoms are likely due to an infection in your vagina rather than pregnancy symptoms.  I recommend evaluation by a gynecologist or your women's health provider to examine your vagina and determine the cause of the discharge. I hope that I was able to adequately answer your question today, and that this information was helpful. Best wishes,"
