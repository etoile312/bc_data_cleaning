  "Q": "Im 13 years old, my chest hurts sometimes, from both sides. Near my heart and the right side as well but not at the same time and not always , what does it mean? , also my boobs kinda hurt when i touch them in certain areas , should I be worried and what does this mean ?",
  "A": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. No need to worry about major heart or lung related diseases as you are too young (13 years) for them. Your bilateral chest pain is mostly due to musculoskeletal pain. So apply warm water pad on affected areas. Avoid movements causing pain. Avoid bad postures in sleep. Avoid heavyweight lifting and strenuous exercise. Take painkiller like ibuprofen. For your breast tenderness, nothing to worry. At your age, hormonal changes are there. And they can cause similar kind of breast pain. Apply ice packs to breasts, and you will be alright. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks."
