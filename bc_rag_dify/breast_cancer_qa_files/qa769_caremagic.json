He has called me on 02nd April for Blood test , I will be 4 weeks 5 days on 2nd April.",
  "A": "Hello Dear Progesterone tablets are known to cause breast tenderness and enlarged nipples. The actual reason why it is prescribed is to support the pregnancy. For you, as you are already on these medications which give rise to symptoms similar to pregnancy, it is difficult to confirm pregnancy unless you get a test done. Till are taking the tablets the periods are likely (not always) to be delayed. So relax, get your blood test done. And meet your doctor. Wishing you luck !"
