  "Q": "I had some very slight drops of red blood from one breast. My dr says I have a 3.4 dilated milk duct in my breast based on a mamo and ultra sound . She does not seem overly concerned as I have no family history of breast cancer but she wants to do a major duct excision. I am reluctant and and have been looking for alternatives. Any suggestions?",
  "A": "I would have liked to know other things about you like your age, number of child Chat Doctor.  Anyway, even with no increased risk I would like to do a cytology of the discharge (the discharge is smeared on a glass slide and seen under a microscope by a pathologist). If that is absolutely normal, then you can follow up with your doctor, initially at monthly intervals and later 3 monthly till the discharge persists. At each visit, repeat the ammo and cytology. At any time any of the reports show even a suspicion of cancer, I would suggest you immediately get the duct excision done."
