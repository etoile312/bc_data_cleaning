  "Q": "Hi. I had breast cancer 5 years ago . I now have a bruised feeling on the under edge of my bottom left rib quite near to the centre of chest. I sometimes think it feels like a mass or lump to touch. Last week I noticed a severe pain which made me cry out. It was very localised pain. It only lasted a second like I had pricked myself with something sharp. This happened 3 or 4 times in a space of a couple of days. Now it just feels bruised to touch under the rib just to left of sternum.",
  "A": "Hi, Thanks for writing in. It is important to do a clinical evaluation of the painful lump which has appeared after treatment for breast cancer. This lump might be due to an infection in the region if it is painful. Usually pain is there due to release of chemicals which cause inflammation. These chemicals are indicators of an infection which might be there in the area. A course of antibiotics might be required after clinical evaluation. Please take complete treatment and get any pus culture done to know the infection causing organism. Search other areas for any similar infection and also get it treated with medicines at the earliest. Please do not worry."
