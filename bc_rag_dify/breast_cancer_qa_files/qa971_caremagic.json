  "Q": "I have done biopsy on my right breast after doctors found a lump and the results came back negative for breast cancer. I have a painful scar on my nipple that has been there for almost 3 years. It wont get bigger or it wont get smaller or it wont go away by itself. I just dont know what this scar is.Many thanks",
  "A": "Hi and thanks for using this panel for your worries. You should be concerned because the scar is itchy and painful. Otherwise, i don't think there is any risk of another cancer right now. This is a mild long term complication of surgeries at the site of incision. I don't know exactly how it looks to qualify it a keloid or not. If it is so annoying, you may want to meet and get it examined. You could also discuss options for excision and maybe some esthetic surgical repair. Do not forget there are also local acting creams that can take care of the itching like calamine lotion Hope this helps.... Wish you a good healthful free to come with more questions. Tthanks"
