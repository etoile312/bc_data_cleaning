I have a history of hemmoargic cysts on ovaries which I went in for surgery a year ago but during surgery doctor said everything was normal since than I am still in still pains in ovaries n have new symptoms of lumps in left breast which I have. A mammogram tomarow",
  "A": "Hi. Thanks for your query. Noted the history and understood your concerns. Lump in breast needs to have a mammogram but more important is the FNAC or excision biopsy if anything serious like cancer is suspected. The bleeding during intercourse has many reasons and not related to any ovarian problems. If a woman is bleeding during sex, the probable reasons are as follows:If this is the first intercourse, this is due to rupture of the hymen, if the bleeding stops and does not occur during further acts, nothing to worry. Another reason is that she is either menstruating or has inter-menstrual bleeding. Another reason is she has some vascular anomaly. You need to consult a Gynecologist to do an internal examination to find the reason and get operated and treated accordingly."
