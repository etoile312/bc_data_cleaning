  "Q": "I have had a chesty cough now for 3 weeks.  After the first week and feeling poorly I went to the doctors and he gave me antibiotics, I felt a lot better straight away but the cough has lasted.  I have been coughing up phlem. Its seems to be all on one side the side I had radiotherapy on 4 years ago after having breast cancer.  I have been taking a cough bottle from the chemist but the cough doesnt seem to be going.",
  "A": "HI, thanks for using Chat Doctor Chesty coughing usually implies that there is bronchitis which is inflammation of the bronchi. It can be viral or bacterial. The cough can last up to 6 weeks in some persons. You may want to consider the use of a bucolic which would help to break up the mucus so that can be more easily expelled. In addition, short term use of a medication to open the airways may be needed. I hope this helps"
