  "Q": "I m a 34 year old female. I ve noticed that my left breast nipple is inverted only when I wear a bra and lay down. I also noticed that my left breast is much smaller than my right, but I only noticed that when I wear a bra. I ve done the usual self breast examine and nothing out of the ordinary, but should I be concerned?",
  "A": "Hello, Just presence of inverted nipple doesn't have any significance. It can be normal also. Nipple becoming inverted and not coming back is a warning sign. If you are not feeling any lump while doing a self-breast examination, that's ok. My suggestion is if you have still doubted, consult a general surgeon and have a mammogram and your doubts will be clarified. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Regard,"
