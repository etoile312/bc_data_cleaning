  "Q": "I THOUGHT MY TEETH & GUMS WERE GIVING ME A SINUS INFECTION.  I WENT TO A NEW (OLD) DENTIST WHO TOOK EXRAYS OF THE ENTIRE MOUTH.  I AM A BREAST CANCER PATIENT WHO IS STILL GOING FOR IMMUNE TREATMENTS.  HE TOLD ME THAT I WAS NOT CLEANING MY TEETH PROPERLY AND I DID NEED A DEEP CLEANING.  HE SHOWED ME HOW TO DO IT PROPERLY AND MAKE THE GUMS BLEED.  HE SAID DO NOT USE TOOTH PASTE OR FLOSS....JUST BRUSH NOT STRAT BUT IN A DIFFERENT BENT WAY AND THAT WILL TAKE OUT EXTRA DEBRI FROM MY GUMS.  HE WANTS A FOLLOW UP APPTS NEXT MONTH.  DO I GO WITH HIM....OR DO I STOP NOW BECAUSE THIS THING GETS TOO FAR FINANCIALLY?  HE ALSO SAID I SEEM TO HAVE A FEW LOOSE TEETH AND MY GUMS ARE NOT HAPPY...HE WANTS TO GIVE ME A NITE BRACE SO THAT I DO NOT GRIND MY TEETH.  WHAT DO I DO?  HE DOES EVERYTHING....MY OLD DENTIST ONLY CLEANED TEETH?",
  "A": "Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query. The bleeding gums could be because of the infected gums secondary to the deposits over the teeth. Consult an oral physician to rule out the gum infection and bruise. For the deposits and bleeding gums oral prophylaxis is enough(scaling and root planing). If you have bruise, you have to use splints during nighttime to prevent damage to the periodontics. I hope my answer will help you, take care."
