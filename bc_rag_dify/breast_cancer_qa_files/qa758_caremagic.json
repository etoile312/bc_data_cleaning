  "A": "Hi, Dear , Good Evening. Thanks for your query to Chat Doctor. This is Chat Doctor.  I studied your query in-depth and understood your health concerns. In My opinion the breast lumps -are benign cyst and hence could be treated as follows-Treatment -a-Anti-oxidant medicinal capsules namely M x 3 capsules is a combination of natural ingredients with it B /mangosteen fruit extracts and others -which have -benign or cancerous breast mass reversing properties and are available as the alternative to surgical interventions for the breast cysts.b-AS your breasts have shown benign cysts-100 % removal of breast cystic mass by surgery is a full proof way to eliminate the lumps for SURE.c-I would suggest the Surgical treatment by a Surgeon, than a Natural MX 3 Capsules-whose results are not full proof in 100 % cases.d-M X 3 capsules you could use -if you have patience for long term "
