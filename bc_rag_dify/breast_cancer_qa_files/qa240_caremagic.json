  "Q": "When I was 15 I noticed a lump in my left breast. I went and got a biopsy and it was ruled as a fibrotic cyst.  Now 5 years later I have another lump but this time in my right breast.  Is this common and is is possible I may have fibrotic breast disease",
  "A": "Hi, Dear Thanks for the query to Chat Doctor virtual Clinic. I studied your query with available details given in your query. I understood your health concerns. Cause of the right breast lump -Though not much information about the location, consistency,size, mobility,fixity of that breast lump is there in the query, On the existing information I would give my opinion herewith. So Don't worry till you get the FNAC Biopsy of the right breast lump, to rule out other causes of such a breast lump. So consult an ER Surgeon. My clinical opinion on your query is-You seem to have Fibroadenoma or Fibrotic breast lump and its possibilities are more-due to following reasons-You already had a history of such a tumor 5 yrs back. Its mostly due to the hormonal imbalance and Genetic predisposition in your case. But still get the mammography and USG guided FNAC biopsy to rule out any chance of malignancy in such breast lumps is needed in your case. If not, Surgical Excision Biopsy with HPR would treat it totally.Don't Self-treat or medicate in your case as the case may go in to further complications. Hope this reply would resolve your query and would help you to plan treatment with your doctor. Hope this would relieve of your health concerns.
