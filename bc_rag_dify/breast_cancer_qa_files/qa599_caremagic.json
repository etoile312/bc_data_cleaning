  "Q": "HAD A BRAIN mri DONE SHOWED A VERY SMALL HAZY NON TUMOROUS AREA ON THE R OCCIPITAL surface AREA not in the brain =TOO SMALL TO MEASURE,NORMALL MY NEUROLOGIST SAID HE WOULD HAVE ME COME BACK IN A FEW MONTHS FOR A FOLLOW UP BUT SINCE I HAD BREAST CANCER 14 YEARS AGO HE WANTS ME TO HAVE AN LP done he has stated that he and 2 other radiologists feel that it is most likely just abnormal blood vessels but because of the stupid breast cancer diagnosis *even without recurrence) they have to be sure-if I didnt have this history, he would with the other radiologists just have me come back in 2-6 months-should I be worried?",
  "A": "Breast cancer if it does not have metastasis in so much time there are very little chance now.  Also breast tumor spread more through lymph nodes so chances of going to brain without involvement of shoulder and axillary lymph nodes are very less.  So be assured.  Get your LP test any way.  As it is always better to know disease at earliest.  If still you are anxious, take an early appointment.  Take care."
