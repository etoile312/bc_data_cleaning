  "Q": "i started taking cerazette about 6 weeks ago and i have this week developed slightly painful breasts that feel hard and a little lumpy. I was also bitten on the breast by a mosquito a few days ago. Most of the redness and swelling has gone but there now feels like there is a lump there, under the site of the bite. Could this be caused by either the bite or the pill? or could it be something more serious?",
  "A": "Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. You have breast lump with pain. It can be due to fibroadenoma, fibroadenomas or some other mass. Chances of lump due to mosquito bite is rare. You should go for mammography. If needed go for fine needle aspiration cytology or biopsy of that lump. It will give you exact diagnosis. Then you should take treatment accordingly Hope I have answered your question, if you have any doubts then contact me at bit.ly/ Chat Doctor. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health."
