  "Q": "yes..thank you... I am taking 325mg bayer asprin since 1991.. I have been in a fib for 3 yrs now..and have a leaky aorta not severe yet...Dr. says stay on the asprin and sees me every 6 months with blood work and yrly echo..i do have some enemia problems so my mother and grandmother..yrs ago it ws called mediterrain enemia..but it comes and goes..is there anything to worry about..oh..my blood levels are more than excellent..and my HDL is off the chart..",
  "A": "I feel your leaky aorta is mild. Medically we call it Aortic regurgitation, and usually it does not need any major intervention. As you have been rightly advised for yearly echo.I often give Tab. Ramipril in dose suitable to level of blood pressure to my patients of aortic regurgitation, which u may discuss with your doctor. Regarding anemia I need more information from your side. I many a time give empirical Iron and multivitamin for a period of 4 weeks and repeat Hemoglobin level. If you are tolerating iron well you may discuss with your doctor for starting it.otherwise your anemia should be evaluated with basic mammogram, peripheral smear and further work up depending upon basic report.I wish u good health."
