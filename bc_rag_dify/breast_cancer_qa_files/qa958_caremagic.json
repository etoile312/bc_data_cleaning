  "Q": "Good evening, my 15 year old daughter told me she found a lump on her breast. After looking at it, its red swollen warm to the touch and tender around the nipple. She started her cycle yesterday and has been on prednisone for a week for a sports injury. Any advice?",
  "A": "Hi.it is best if you consult with a doctor, preferably a general surgeon, for physical examination and clinical evaluation. It may be just an inflammatory reaction secondary to the injury she had, which will subside in a few days time on its own. If infected, antibiotics will be prescribed. Other lesions (such as hematoma, abscess and tumor lesions) must also be ruled-out. Breast ultrasound may be of great help. Other diagnostics (blood exams, tissue biopsy) and management (medical and/or surgical) will be directed accordingly. Hope this helps. Good day!!~ Chat Doctor. "
