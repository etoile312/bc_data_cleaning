  "Q": "Curious, if you could give me some answers. For the last 2 months we have been trying to get pg. April 12 had my cycle, so not pg. This month having tenderness in breasts, some items dont appeal to me (smell), queasy, (I havent thrown up) different times of day for last wk. However 6am today woke to spotting when I wiped not normal cycle and havent even used 1/2 of one pad today. Im extremely tired (wore down) today, possibly just cuz Im bummed a little. But any idea whats up with this? Could I be pg, just having Decidual Bleeding or implantation occuring? Thanks for any suggestions, help. CJ",
  "A": "Hi, Thanks for the query. I understand your concern.  There are two possibilities with your spotting around periods along with breast tenderness since few days -In case bleeding is scanty stops in a day or two (unlike routine period) ... and home pregnancy test with a clean urine collected in a clean container .done after an 8 days later turns +ve. You are pregnant.  -OR -Breast tenderness could be premenstrual . the spotting may be followed by normal menstrual bleeding...the menses may get few days late due to anxiety of getting pregnant.  *please don't be scared ...provided both of you are normal (checked for fertility-before planning for a baby) you will conceive in months to come.  Thanks."
