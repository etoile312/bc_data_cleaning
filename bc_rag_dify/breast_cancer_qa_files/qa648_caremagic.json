  "Q": "hi i am 19 weeks and 3 days pregnant and have been told that i have low lying placenta ..also underwent ovarain dermoid cystectomy when i was 13 weeks pregnant...in view of above my doc has put me on progestrone tab SUSTEN 200 ,,,kindly advise if i should continue as there has been no spotting so far",
  "A": "Hello, and I hope I can help you today. Oral progesterone has no role in the management of pregnancy after the first trimester. You do not need to worry at this point that it has actually hurt the baby, as progesterone is produced in normal healthy pregnancies. In your case, your history of a mastectomy and your low-lying placenta (which likely will go away by the third trimester) are not actual risk factors for any obstetric complications. So I do not believe that you need to continue the progesterone therapy. There is no harm to the pregnancy that could have come from taking it in the first place, as injectable and suppository forms of the Chat Doctor. So in summary, as long as you have no further complications of your ovaries, and your low-lying placenta resolves by term, there is no reason that you may not have a normal vaginal delivery. I hope I was adequately able to answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. Best wishes for the rest of the pregnancy,"
