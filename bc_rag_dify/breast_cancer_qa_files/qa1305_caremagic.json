  "Q": "whenever I lie down for a long period I wake up n spit a little bit of blood n after a couple seconds it goes back to clear. im not sure where this is coming from? I went tot he dentist she filled in cavitys n said I might njeed a root canal...could bad gums bleed without bothering them? where is the blood coming from?",
  "A": "Hello, Welcome Thanks for consulting Chat Doctor, I have gone through your query, as you have gone to dentist, and he advised you Root canal treatment you should go for it, blood can be due to gingival bleeding due to poor oral hygiene also You should go for proper treatment and oral prophylaxis if again you find blood in mouth then consult physician and go for investigations Complete mammogram, Hope this will help you.  Wish you good health Regards "
