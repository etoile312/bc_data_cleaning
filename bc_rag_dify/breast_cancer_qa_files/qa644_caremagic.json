  "Q": "Hi, may I answer your health queries right now ?  Please type your query here...My HIDA scan said I had a high ejection rate.  For 5 days now I have been very nauseated, pain and buring under my brests, especially on the right side, ocassional chills and the pain is constant, but worse the further I get away from eating.  Could the 2 be related?",
  "A": "Hi there, I don't believe that this is related. I see a lot of patients with abnormal HIDE scans, and the only ones that are worrisome and would cause problems are the ones with low ejection fraction.  A high ejection fraction means that your gallbladder is working very well, and isn't cause for any concern.  Gallbladder problems are unrelated to breast pain. If you haven't had a mammogram, I'd recommend that. If you are a younger patient, then an ultrasound of your breasts might be more helpful.  I hope I have answered your questions. Please feel free to contact me should you have any further questions."
