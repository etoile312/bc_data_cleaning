  "Q": "This week suddenly, I have multiple painful canker sores in my mouth, my lower face is swollen up and sore like I was punched, even where there is no canker sores any where close. My left arm pit is very tender in one spot in particular and sore around it. I feel achy and tired. My hips and back hurt when I lay down to rest. I have a tender spot on my thigh that feels like a bad bruise but I don t remember injuring myself and I can t see a color bruise. I am a 43 year old female in general good health (I think) that goes to the doctor regularly for checkups. I had a screening mammogram yesterday but did not have orders for a diagnostic so they couldn t do that. I just had biometric blood testing that came out ok but not sure what that means. I recently had my teeth cleaned and have excellent oral hygiene .",
  "A": "Hello, Thanks for posting your query. Canker sore treatment depends on size and severity. Mix salt in warm water in your mouth for 30 sec. HY Chat Doctor.  Most canker sores go away on their own in a week or two. Check with your doctor or dentist if you have unusually large or painful canker sores or canker sores that don't seem to heal. Over-the-counter and prescription pastes with active ingredients such as endocrine (Anderson), amlexanox and fluocinonide can help relieve pain and speed healing if applied to individual sores as soon as they appear. Regards."
