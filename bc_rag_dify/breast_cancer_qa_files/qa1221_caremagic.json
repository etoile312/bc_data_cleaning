  "A": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your situation and problem. You had primary breast cancer and mostly secondary spread in lungs. Lung metastasis in breast cancer carries poor prognosis. The only option left is chemotherapy. And the relapse rate is very high. Bronchitis is also seen together with lung cancer.  It is due to continuous inflammation in the lung. The best option for you, at this stage is to consult oncologist and get done1.  CT thorax 2. Pet scan. These will give you exact idea about lung cancer."
