  "Q": "My doctor ordered an ultra sound for both breasts after my mammogram showed density in my right breast and a nodule in my left breast. I am 80 years old and went through surgery for uterine cancer and subsequently chemo in 2010. I didn t finish my chemo at the oncologist s suggestion as it was doing a lot of damage to other parts of my body. I worked until my 80th birthday and retired, not because I wanted to but because my health just wouldn t let me continue. I just don t know if I can handle having cancer again. What percentage of dense breasts and nodules are cancer?",
  "A": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. In my opinion, high possibility of cancerous nodules. Reasons for this1. Known case of uterine cancer2. Not completed chemotherapy as advised by oncophysician.3. Old age is the risk factor for spread in breast. So I advise you to get done biopsy of the nodules and rule out malignancy. So first get done ultrasound and then guided biopsy is required in your case to rule out malignant breast nodules."
