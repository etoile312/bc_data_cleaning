  "Q": "I had breast cancer and a double mastectomy no May 17th of this year.  I had to have seven nodes taken out and that has not healed yet.  I go to the hospital every Monday for wound care.  It is finally starting heal from the inside out.  What I am really worried about is my cancer Dr. Has never done ANYTHING at all.  He has never looked at my wound or giving me any cancer treatments.  I do not even know if they got all of the cancer.  What should I do???",
  "A": "Hi and thank you so much for this query. I am sorry to hear about your battle with breast cancer and the healing wounds. I can only wish you the best of outcomes here. Back to your worry, I would suggest that you take an appointment and ask your doctor what the pathology readings from samples obtained during surgery showed. This is because, in cases of surgery for cancer, we send specimens to the lab of a more detailed reading that would help guide management. I very much hope this was done with you. Also, ask him what are the next plans about your treatment and when is that going to start. As for the wound care, surgeons don't really return to do routine wound care unless there is a complication. As for me, I am always updated on the progress and only called in to evaluate especially when something worrisome comes up. I strongly think that he has not come because you have not had anything which seems out of the normal that requires extra care. I hope this helps. Furthermore, I wish you the very best of possible outcomes. Thanks and feel free to return and ask you ore questions if you need arises."
