  "Q": "I have found a lump in my breast, Ive already had a doctors appointment where she tested it for a cyst but was unable to draw any fluid and therefore referred me to the hospital.  My appointment is in a weeks time but I suppose like anyone in my situation Im really worried.  The lump is quite large, hard and bumpy in texture.  There is no history of breast cancer in my family....",
  "A": "Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. You may have some benign proliferative breast lesion like fibroadenoma, fibroadenomas or fibrotic disease.  Or you may breast cancer. You should go for mammography and biopsy of that lump. It will give you exact diagnosis. Then you should take treatment accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health."
