  "A": "Hello, As you have breast cancer have you undergone any surgical excision of the same? During the breast cancer, there is the possibility of inflammation of the lymph nodes and this may lead to a reduced venous return. Also, you are 80, so we can expect the venous return to being abnormal due to any abnormal pathology. But with using upper limb stockings your swelling should reduce and do some simple exercises for the upper limb which is swollen. You should do well. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Jay In Chat Doctor. "
