  "A": "Your question is very broad. Because conceiving is not as easy as people think and at the same time some people do not have any problem in conceiving. So for that you have to consult once with an infertologist and have detailed counselling session about how treatment goes and what to expect during treatment. Second it is normal to have watery discharge in second half of your menstrual cycle, and it is because of a hormone named progesterone and estrogen secreted inside your body. And yes it will remain same or increase to some extent in early pregnancy because the level of same hormone increases during pregnancy. And due to which you have somewhat discharge.SG and TVs are normal, but there are 100s of thing which are required to be in order to have pregnancy. You may need some investigations like mammogram, insulin, prolactin, Sugar level, Thyroid function test, husband semen report.  These are basic and may require others according to clinical examination and history."
