  "A": "Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. You may have enlarged axillary lymph node. It may be due to reactive hyperplasia, tuberculosis, lymphoma or metastatic cancer. You should go for biopsy or fine needle aspiration cytology of lump and mammography of your breast. It will give you exact idea regarding diagnosis. Then you should take treatment accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have any doubts then contact me at bit.ly/ Chat Doctor.
