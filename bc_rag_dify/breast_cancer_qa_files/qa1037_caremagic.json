  "Q": "I am 76. Diagnosed with breast cancer in 2007. Had a lumpectomy. More tumors found, and one large against chest wall. Mastectomy. Had Chemo. Took Arimidex (spelling??) for 4 years 10 months. Was in pain everyday. The breast cancer had recurred., same side, chest wall. I had lumpectomy on Oct. 6. Pathology showed it to be recurrence. Pet scan showed no where else in my body. Nov. 12, more surgery to take out more tissue to try for clear margins. After healing, radiation. Then Arimidex for 5-10 years. Or Tomaxifen for 5-10 years. I know how I feel everyday on Arimidex. And, Tomaxifen causes heart problems. I have a family history of heart disease. I question...why bother after the surgery and radiation?? Thank you. Anne Marie Martainez",
  "A": "Hi Anne Marie Martinez, The breast cancer is a systemic disease i.e. it involves all the system in the body. Surgery and radiation will only take care of disease in the breast. There is a spread of small cancer cells to other parts of the body called micrometastases. So these cells can regrow later time. This is the reason the chemotherapy or hormonal therapy is recommended to kill these small cancer cells which cannot be detected by investigations. Hope I have answered your question"
