  "Q": "Im 63 with  asthma, usually well controlled.  Dev dry cough for 2-3 last week.  Called my pulmonary doc who put me on Z pack last Fri.  Phegm was creamy yellow. By Sat pm had low grade fever up to 100.6 by Sun pm.  By Mon phlegm was brownish Called pulmonary doc back on Mon- he switched me to Ceftin 500 2X day.  Today is Wed and fever has been gone since yesterday morning.  Feeling much better.  Energy returning.  QUESTION is: Is it safe for me to have dinner tomorrow (Thurs evening) with friend who is having chemo for breast cancer.  I will have been on anitbiotic (seftin) since Mon night following 3 days on Z pack.  Coughing is now minimal.  Can you advise?",
  "A": "Hi, If you are recovering from cough with septum and fever then it is good but need to continue the full course as per your pulmonologist advise. Now there is no question of dietary restrictions with anyone despite he or she is on chemotherapy or not. Yes if you still feel not completely comfortable then you can have soft diet only for another couple of days and continue with your asthma medication. Thanks"
