  "Q": "Hi tonight in the shower I found a few bumps on my nipple. Not like a tumor bump but almost like the size of a pimple but a little bit bigger. I know its not an STD but Im freaking out a little that it might be cancer or something, what are the chances?",
  "A": "Hi, Thanks for writing in. Bumps on nipple do not indicate cancer. It might be due to benign condition including infection or due to hormonal changes. However, it is suggested that you have it examined by the surgeon and observe for progressive changes over the next few days. In most probability you do not have cancer if it is the size of a pimple and not exactly a lump. You have not mentioned any pain over the area. If there is pain then a possibility of an infective pimple is more likely. Please do self breast examination of both breasts and armpits to know if there is any suspicious lump which requires medical attention. Please do not worry."
