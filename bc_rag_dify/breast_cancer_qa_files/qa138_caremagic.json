  "A": "Hi, thank you for providing the brief history of you. As you mentioned the difference in the thoughts of the Radiologist and the oncologist that is making you confuse. It is not a case of worry, as you can request both of your oncologist and Radiologist to have a discussion on your case and then plan to a proper rehabilitation process. I am sure they won't have problem talking and discussing on their ideas and come to a proper treatment. As both may have different thinking in mind taking to your case after assessing you. Both are not wrong, but the variation of the thoughts are making you confuse. So patients comfort is the first line of action which they can do by meeting up and discussing your case. I am sure you will be at comfort once they both have a discussion as the principle of medical to keep the patient at optimum comfort. RegardsJay In Chat Doctor. "
