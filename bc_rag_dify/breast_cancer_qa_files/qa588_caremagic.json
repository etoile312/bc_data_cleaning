  "Q": "My partner has a sharp pain in her right lung and has some difficulty breathing comfortably. Her temperature has risen from 36.5 to 37.8 since this afternoon and she feels a bit feverish. Any ideas? She had surgery last March for breast cancer and had chemo through the summer and radiotherapy through the autumn. Is the very cold weather a likely contributor?",
  "A": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. Possibility of lower respiratory tract infection (LETI - pneumonia) is more in your friends case. Yes, cold weather must have contributed to her current illness. She is also a cancer survivor and took chemotherapy and radiotherapy. This makes her immunocompromised and more prone for infection. Her symptoms like fever, chest pain, breathing difficulty etc. favor pneumonia more. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done 1. Clinical examination of respiratory system 2. Chest x-ray 3. Sputum culture and sensitivity report. Chest x-ray is must for the diagnosis of pneumonia. Sputum culture will isolate the causative organism and sensitivity report will guide about effective antibiotic treatment. Don't worry she will be alright. Consult pulmonologist and discuss all these. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wishing good health to your friend. Thanks."
