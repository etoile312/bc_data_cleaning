  "Q": "i had breast cancer 1 yr ago, 50 years old, they removed the lympnodes.  now i have symptons of vertigo so they did a dobbler test on my right side of neck.  found cyst and lympnodes.  havent heard from doctor yet. should i be worried.  i still have a mri scheduled for brain w/o contrast to be done.",
  "A": "Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. Treatment depends on the cause.  If your lymph node and cyst are due to metastasis from breast cancer, or it is due to some other cause.  If it is metastatic breast cancer then chemotherapy is required.  If it is due to some other cause then take treatment accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health."
