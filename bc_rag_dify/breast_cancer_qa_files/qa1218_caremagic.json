  "Q": "I had unprotected sex on Friday night. 4-5 hours later I took the Next Choice emergency contraceptive. I then read that it does not work well on women with a BMI of 25 or higher. My BMI is 29.1. I went Saturday morning to an Urgent Care Clinic to try and get a prescription for ELLA. They would not see me. I should have my period on Wednesday or Thursday of this week. I don t know whether to try and go to a dr. tomorrow (hard to get into obgyn) or wait a week and see what happens.",
  "A": "Hallow Dear, Next Choice Emergency contraceptive is fairly reliable post-coital contraceptive pill. It does prevent pregnancy when taken within 72 hours of unprotected sex. It contains Levonorgestrel as active medicine in that. You should not be concerned about your BMI 29. It will act on you to prevent the pregnancy. There is no necessity of going for additional Ella Emergency contraceptive pills. These pills also are quite reliable post-coital contraceptive pills. Ella is an emergency contraceptive pill containing 30 mg of ulipristal acetate, a progesterone receptor modulator. It is effective for up to 5 days after unprotected sex. I feel you need not be concerned about the failure of Next Choice emergency contraceptive pills. For the confirmation, you may perform Beta Chat Doctor test on your blood 10 days after the unprotected sex. Alternatively, you may wait for your menses. Since you have taken Next Choice emergency contraceptive pills, your periods will be delayed by about a week or so. Even after week, you do not get periods, you may perform pregnancy test on the overnight morning first urine sample; earlier these tests may report false negative results. I hope this helps you to get relief from the stress. "
