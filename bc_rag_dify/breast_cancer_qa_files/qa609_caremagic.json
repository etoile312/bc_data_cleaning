  "Q": "Hi, I am a nineteen year old female, and about three days ago I noticed I have a dime sized lump on my right mastoid bone. It is not movable and only causes me pain when I touch it. It is not red or irritated. It is not a bug bite, surely not a blemish, and is very hard, almost bone hard. I have had many ear infections as a kid and know positively that this is not a simple ear infection. I looked up a lot on mastoiditis and cysts. I am no medical professional but I can rule out both just based on the symptoms listed. I have been feeling very fatigued and my lower back/ kidney area has been hurting severely for multiple days. If it is any help, two of my grandmothers on my mothers side had cancer. One had ovarian and the other had breast cancer. I am running out of idea on what it could be and am getting quite frustrated. Going to see a doctor is the next step, but for now I am just looking for possible answers.",
  "A": "Sounds like an enlarged lymph node. Painful enlarged lymph nodes are usually infectious in nature. It can be caused by an ear infection like you have guessed and ruled out or it could be something as simple as acne/pimples in your scalp that has caused it. Based on your description, it is not suspicious for cancer. As for the lower back pain, it could be a lumbar strain. Is it associated with your period? Do you know what activities exacerbate it, and what relieves it? Do you have pain when you move/ bend or when you urinate?"
