  "Q": "I have found a lump in my labia that was painful, but now is just like a lump with no sensation at all.  It is about as large as the end of my thumb.  As 3 members of my family (2 sisters with breast cancer and a brother with brain cancer) have had cancer( 1 sister died...breast cancer-went to bone cancer-went to cervical cancer, sister in remission from breast cancer,-brother in treatment for brain cancer), I am worried. I have no insurance.Can you help relieve my concerns?",
  "A": "Hi ! Good morning. I am Chat Doctor answering your query. From the description by you about the lump, it seems more like a Bartholdi cyst (a benign cyst) which got inflamed initially causing the pain, and now it is just persisting as a cyst after the inflammation subsided. However, the exact situation could be known after a physical examination of the lesion by a general surgeon/gynecologist. With your family history which can not be ignored, I would suggest you take an appointment with the doctor, or show yourself in a government hospital as the case may be. I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem. Please do not hesitate to ask in case of any further doubts. Thanks for choosing Chat Doctor to clear doubts on your health problems. Wishing you an early recovery. Chat Doctor."
