  "Q": "I have what appears to be stretch marks on one of my breasts, which is also significantly larger than the other in size. I sometimes also experience instances of shooting pains in my chest, although they dont last for more than a few minutes. I am 19 and have never been pregnant. What might the cause of this?",
  "A": "Usually the stretch marks occur when 1. The size of the body organ beneath the skin enlarges rapidly or 2. Suddenly looses size after being large for some time. As you correctly thought of, these things commonly occur in or after pregnancy. But in your case as you already said you've never been pregnant, but one breast is larger than other there must be some tissue or mass under the skin need to get the breast examination done by a surgeon or a gynecologist"
