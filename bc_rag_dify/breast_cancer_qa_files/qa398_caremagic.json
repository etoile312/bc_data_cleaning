  "Q": "I am going to stop Hormone replacement since a questionable mammogram last fall. Am due another mammogram in July. Have been on HRT for approx. 10 yrs or more. Originally placed on it due to menopause symptoms but those symptoms have almost completely disappeared. Need to wean off or just stop?",
  "A": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your situation and problem. In my opinion you should continue hormone replacement therapy (HRT) till follow-up mammography. And if follow-up mammography is improved or same as previous mammography than you can taper down HRT. Don't stop suddenly. This will cause you more trouble. You need to taper it down slowly over 2-3 months to avoid rebound effect. So don't do it yourself, consult your doctor and discuss all these."
