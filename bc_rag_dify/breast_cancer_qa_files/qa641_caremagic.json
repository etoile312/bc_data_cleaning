  "Q": "hello, my problem is i get unbearable breast pains 3 weeks before my periods specially towards the armpit & runs down to the breast area, it worries me as i have a family history of breast cancer in the family aswell. have done a memogram 4 years ago, all it showed was a shadow closer to the armpit. pls advise.",
  "A": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. In my opinion you should first get done mammography of bilateral breast. And if any lump is present in either breast or maxilla than biopsy of the lump is must rule out breast cancer. In my opinion you are having hormonal imbalance and due to this you are having breast pain during menses. But you are having positive family history and query shadow before 4 years, so we need to rule out breast cancer first. So get done mammography."
