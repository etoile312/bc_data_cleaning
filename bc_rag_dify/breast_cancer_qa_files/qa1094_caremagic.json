  "Q": "My breasts have been really sore and my chest bone feels bruised. ive noticed hard lumps on my breasts for years but i dont know if its just my chest bone or anything serious. i didnt go to the doctors before because i was scared. well now its causing me pain so i went to the doctor yesterday and he just gave me ibuprofen and said that it might be because of lifting heavy things but ive noticed it for years, i dont think he understood me he seemed like he was trying to rush me out of there. im only 17 and i have had a baby 6 months ago but i noticed it before i got pregnant. im scared if its cancer of the bone or breast or is it bruised? please tell me im so worried and confused.",
  "A": "Hello! Breast pain is usually caused by the female hormones called estrogen, the female breast is very sensitive to estrogen.  However since you also said you gave birth 6 months ago it is also important to know whether you are still lactating/breastfeeding, which can also cause the lumps/tenderness/soreness.  If you have lumps on your breast, I suggest you get a breast ultrasound to rule out any masses (which could be due to cysts, milk ducts, etc.).  For now, you can place warm compress over the painful areas for 15 minutes to decrease the swelling, and take the medicine prescribed to you, while you are scheduling for further diagnostic exam."
