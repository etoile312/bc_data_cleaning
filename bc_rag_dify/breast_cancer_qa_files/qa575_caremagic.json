  "Q": "I have recently visited a sexual health centre to discuss the contraceptive pill . I was given a prescription of the combined pill but, on reading the leaflet enclosed in the pill box, I noticed the list of side effects. It seems that the mini-pill has a lot less side effects than the combined pill. I was wondering to what extent this was true. I also wondered if there was any advantage in the combined pill and why the majority of women chose this over the combined. Is there any gain to be had from the worse side effects when the mini-pill can do the same job? Thank you",
  "A": "Hello mam, thanks for trusting Chat Doctor. Mini pill is usually prescribed to lactating mothers because it has no effect on breast milk.in other patients in my practice I prefer giving combined pills because mini pill causes -irregular spotting and highly irregular periods-depression and breast tenderness-pre disposes to thromboembolism in certain females In case you have further questions you can consult me on Chat Doctor forum and I will be happy to helpmate care and wish you all the best.
