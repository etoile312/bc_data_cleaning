  "Q": "Last year I had microcalifications in my left breast. I had the area removed and thank God it was benign.  This year I went for my routine mammogram and this time they found the exact same thing on my right breast.  I had a stereotatic biopsy on yesterday and I am currently waiting for the results.  I am a 48 year old african american woman with two children. I had a total hysterectomy May of 2012.  Should I be concerned about this reoccurence?  Is this something that is stress relateed?  Diet related?  Is this like a pre-cursor to breast cancer?  I do have a history of breast cancer in my family on my mothers side. She had two sisters that had breast cancer and both have passed away.",
  "A": "HelloFresh calcification is a common finding in mammogram. Most of the time it is benign process, but sometimes this can be due to cancer. There are 2 types of calcification. Macro calcification is usually benign and needs no further test but microcalcification can be benign which is the case in 80% of lesion or can be cancerous. So for confirmation or if it looks doubtful you have to do repeat mammogram or biopsy. It is good that you have undergone biopsy and it will give you definite answer. Although it is not directly related to stress, reducing fat rich diet helps in reducing risk of breast cancer. Regards"
