  "Q": "around 7 days ago, i noticed this suddenly developed rubbery lump/disc under my left nipple. There is no swelling, its a little sore. I think it is due to my protein supplement named Body Fuel. This was a changed supplement than my regular one and i start taking it 8-10 days back. Prior to this supplement, my dosage was 2 scoops on training day and 1 scoop on non training day. But I changed the dosage for this new Body Fuel supplement and i start taking 3 scoops (providing 45 g protein) on work out day and 1 scoop otherwise. Also i was went to the gym for workout just 2 days in a week. I this lump formation due to inferior quality supplement or its sudden dosage change (with insufficient workout) or is there something else happening in my body???I am a pure vegetarian. And today I saw abrupt and very high hair fall it was like 40-50 hair falling and this was very very abrupt for me.",
  "A": "Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. Your breast lump has no relation with your food supplement.  It may be due to some benign breast lesion like fibrotic disease or may be malignant.  You should go for fine needle aspiration cytology and demography.  It will give you exact idea regarding cause. Then you should take treatment accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then you can contact me at Bitly Chat Doctor.  Wish you a very good health."
