  "Q": "I had thyroid cancer and thyroid was removed in March this year. I also had breast cancer in feb this year. I completed my radiation 4 weeks ago. I am 50 and on Synthroid 200. during the day I am very very cold (shivering) and then at times very very hot (sweaty). I feel like my heart beats funny--fast or slow??? Just funny. kinda feels like its shaky...I talked to the dr today and she acted like I was nuts. She did take blood and said she call me next week. Should I be on calcium and vitamin B as well?",
  "A": "Hi, Thanks for writing in. There are many causes for a fluttering heart beat, and it is possible that the Synthroid 200 might be causing it in you. The freezing feeling and hot and sweaty at times can be from thyroid imbalance. This is to be evaluated after doing thyroid function test and then knowing any abnormal values. Calcium is a natural ion required in our food and women over 50 years need more calcium because there is a tendency to develop osteoporosis after menopause. Therefore, taking calcium is beneficial for you and in the recommended dose it will keep you in good health. Vitamin B in many types is required for functioning of cells and nerves. This is a water-soluble vitamin and essential micro nutrient. Please take plenty of fruits and vegetables which are natural sources of vitamin B. You can take supplement which is available. Please do not worry."
