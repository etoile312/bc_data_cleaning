  "Q": "Two weeks ago, I started feeling Ill.  My two occipital lymph nodes swelled up more so than I have ever remembered.  In fact, I dont ever remember them swelling or painful in my 30 years.  I had an awful drenching night sweat that night and the next day began having on and off fevers and chills.  The odd thing is that I have zero other flu like symptoms.  No sneezing, no coughing, no congestion or runny nose, no diarrhea or vomiting.  I did have a loss of appetite for a week and a half but have regained it.  My fever is now gone, but the swelling and pain is still there along with an uptick in these awful drenching night sweats.  It has been two weeks and I am a bit worried.",
  "A": "Dear Friend. The night sweats, fever, appetite loss, weight loss. These symptoms occur in tuberculosis or lymphoma. However, the occipital lymph nodes are not a common presentation, but who knows that you have other lymph nodes too which a doctor can find on examination. It is also possible that you simply have a bacterial abscess on your occipital area. I would advise you to take it seriously and meet a physician.
