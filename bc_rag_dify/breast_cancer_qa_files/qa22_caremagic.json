  "A": "Hello. Thank you for sharing your concern with us. It does sound like it might be an infection-the armpit hurting suggests that you might have some inflamed lymph nodes. The pimple that you are noticing now might have been there for a while and the small hole that you are talking about might be what is left of the pimple, which might have Chat Doctor.  I would suggest that you visit a doctor for a check-up and to have this problem looked into, especially since you have a breast implant. You might need some antibiotics to clear the infection, although the decision for antibiotics will be left at the discretion of your primary care physician. All in all, I think that it is better for you not to ignore the situation and to seek medical help with your primary care doctor. In most likelihood, it is just an infection and hopefully your symptoms will resolve with the appropriate treatment. I hope that my advice was helpful. Best regards"
