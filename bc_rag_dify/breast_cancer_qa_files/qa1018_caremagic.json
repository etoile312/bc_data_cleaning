  "Q": "My mom is 74 yrs. old.  She was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2001 & has been in remission until recently, as the cancer has spread to lymph node near clavicle, lungs, & is attached to esophagus.   She also has a schatzki ring & is unable to eat/drink.  She gags herself & regurgitates everything.  Some days she gets a little bit down, but Im concerned she is dehydrated.  She has lost a lot of weight in the past year - about 80 lbs (was 200 now down to 120).  She is a difficult patient & her doctors are not working together.  She refuses to get a peg, which was recommended.  She was in the hospital recently due to a fall & was fed with an IV - went home after 3 days feeling better.  She had an esophageal x-ray & was told there is no obstruction in the esophagus.  Im scared she is dying, but none of the doctors are talking.",
  "A": "Hi, What was the exact diagnosis? Difficulty in swallowing commonly occur due to pathology in esophagus. Breast cancer can spread to the maxilla, supraclavicular region, supraclavicular region and at distant site. It is mandatory to rule out the distant metastasis at this phase also. Upper G-I endoscopy may be an option. Right now the problems are there due to poor nutritional status. Consult your doctor how to maintain the nutrition. Nutritional support can improve the symptoms. Take care of your mother."
