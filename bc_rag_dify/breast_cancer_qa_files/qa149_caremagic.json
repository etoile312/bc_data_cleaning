  "Q": "i have had a lump in my armpit -breast for about 6 weeks now. I went to the doctors whom confirmed a definate lump and has sent me to the Rappid Access Clinic. My lump doesnt hurt although this week it has started to feel uncomfortable when my arm is down. I am 45 and had hysterectomy 9 years ago,ovaries removed also. I had a big lump removed on my right breast around the nipple 25 years ago,that was benign,do you think it could be the same thing. The is no history as far as i know of breast cancer but my moms brothers and sisters have died of lung and prostrate cancer that had spread.",
  "A": "Hi, dear. I have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. You may have lymph node enlargement in the armpit area.  It may be reactive for tuberculosis or metastatic from your recurrent cancer. Or it may be recurrent breast cancer.  So the best thing to do is go for FNAC of that lump.  It will give you exact diagnosis.  Then take treatment accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health."
