  "A": "Hi! Good evening. I am Chat Doctor answering your query. You did not mention your gender. Developing such lumps in case of a male person in this age group happens not infrequently, and is due to hormonal changes in this age. These usually subside by themselves excepting in a few in which case you might have to consult a plastic surgeon if disturbing both physically and mentally. In case of females also, this might be due to some hormonal changes, and this would need a clinical assessment. If clinical assessment was inconclusive, then one could go for FNAC (fine needle aspiration cytology) to have a cytological diagnosis and then proceed further. I would advise you to be calm and not to get nervous, as your apprehension might not be sure most of the time in this age group. However, you must consult/visit your doctor for regular follow up as per his advice. Till then, you could go for an anti inflammatory Chat Doctor. "
