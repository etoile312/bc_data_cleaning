  "Q": "Sir I have fever since 3 week. Initially I was diagnosed as Malaria FR. I took GEN-M 40/240 mg (Artemether + Lumefantrine) two time three days. But still I was getting fever. So doctor recommend to get few tests (i-e ICT Malaria and Widal) malaria was negative but typhoid was positive. So doctor recommend me the Novidate 250 mg (ciprofloxacin HCL) two time a day. I continued it for 10 days but still I was getting fever. Then again I check to a renowned doctor he recommend me Levofloxcin 250 and then 500 two time a day. Now I am improving but fever is still coming.",
  "A": "Thanks for your query at Chat Doctor! I am Infectious Disease Specialist! I went through your query! It is sometimes possible that there might be a coinfection of malaria and typhoid but rare. How were you diagnosed of malaria for first time? Get microscopy by gains test done to confirm diagnosis. Sometimes these two tests can cross-react. So I advise that you get your blood culture test done. You must get properly evaluated if fever is still persisting. Also get Dengue serology tests, complete mammogram, LFT and abdominal USG done. I feel you are in recovering phase and things will improve this week. Happy to take more queries! You can also write a review for me. If you would like some more information, I will be happy to provide. You can take a follow-up query. Take care!"
