  "Q": "I think i may be pregnant but im on the contraceptive implant. I have most of the symtoms like headaches, light bleeding constantly, sore back, sore stomach below the bellybutton, my sides hurt, tender breasts, hot flushes and sickness. Me and my partner have had alot of sex, around 8 - 15 times a week and its always been unprotected, please help?",
  "A": "Hello, and I hope I can help you today. The contraceptive implant, if it is not expired (usually it lasts 2 years) is absolutely effective in preventing pregnancy by preventing you from ovulating. This you will not menstruate regularly while the implant is working. Actually the fact that your period is irregular is a sign that the implant is working, no matter how often you have sex. Furthermore, all the symptoms that you describe, like the breast tenderness, hot flashes, headaches and irregular bleeding are all potential side effects of the implant. These side effects tend to get better after the first 6 months of use. So to be on the safe side, you could check a urine pregnancy test, but it is extremely doubtful that any of your symptoms are due to pregnancy. Pelvic pain can also be caused by infections, and you shouldn't see your women's health provider to make sure you do my have a UTI or vaginal infection that could be complicating the issue. I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. Best wishes,"
