  "A": "Hello, and I hope I can help you today. Pregnancy symptoms can vary widely between women, and all the symptoms you describe-nausea, bloating, breast tenderness and feeling weak can also be caused by the hormone imbalance that caused you to miss your period. But you can trust the pregnancy test to be reliable if you took it at least 14 days from possible conception. A delayed cycle can occur from sudden weight loss or gain, traveling or a change in schedule, or even stress. Worrying about pregnancy can even make you stressed enough to miss a period. All your symptoms will resolve once you do get your menstrual cycle again. I suggest you wait until your next period would be due and if you do not get one then I suggest consulting with a GUN doctor to investigate your irregular cycles. But I can reassure you that if your pregnancy test is negative, whatever symptoms you have been not caused by pregnancy. I hope I was able to answer your question today and that this information was reassuring. Best wishes, "
