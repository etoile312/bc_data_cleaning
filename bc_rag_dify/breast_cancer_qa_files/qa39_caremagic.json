  "Q": "Hi, I am a 19 year old female. I found a fairly large lump in my right breast that has been there for over a year. It has grown alot, im not exactly sure how much, since I last saw my endocrine doctor. I also have hypothyroidism and have been on synthroind 75 and sometimes up to 100 mcg. The lump in my right breast is very hard and it is tender to touch. I have very small breasts so it is hard to tell if it is completly mobile or if it is the surrounding tissue moving around too. The right breast has dark blue veins surrounding my areola, while my other breast has none. And the nipple is a little larger too. Sorry to get really personal. Thank you for your answer and your time.",
