  "A": "Hi.it is best if you consult with a doctor, preferably a general surgeon in regard to your concern. It may be any of the following benign breast lesions: cystic, fibroid or fibrotic changes. Other tumor types, such as malignancy, must also be ruled-out. Clinical evaluation is best. Diagnostics (such as breast ultrasound and/or mammography, tissue biopsy) may be recommended. Management (medical and/or surgical) will be directed accordingly. Hope this helps. Good day!!~ Chat Doctor. "
