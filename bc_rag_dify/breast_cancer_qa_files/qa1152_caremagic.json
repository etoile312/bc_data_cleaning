  "Q": "Hi, may I answer your health queries right now ?  Please type your query here...I was supposed to have had a 4 millimeter lump surgically removed from my breast through needle-guided aspiration because the radiologist could not determine what it was.  However, when the radiologist inserted the needle it went deep into the 4 millimeter lumpspot and liquid came out so there was nothing to surgically remove or test.  They did mammogram and concluded it was a cyst and recommended follow up in 6 months.  However, I am now a little concern that if there were cancer cells inside of this tiny unknown spot/lump, wouldnt the cancer cells be released when the needle burst it?  And, how would I know because there was nothing left to test? Thank you.",
  "A": "Hi, Thanks for writing in. A 4 mm lesion in the breast is too small to characterize. The needle FNAC was offered probably to be more accurate in making a diagnosis. If the lump of cells in the 4 mm area was properly targeted then appearance of liquid confirms the presence of a cyst with fluid. Even in the aspirated fluid, there would have been cells and I guess that slides were prepared and seen under a microscope in your case. If it was indeterminate then it means that no cancer cells were confirmed in the area. Technically speaking even if the 4 mm area was burst with the needle then the cells were confined to a closed area and will not spill over to any other area. Also, it might have been close to the skin surface. Please be informed that breast cancer does not have a tendency to spread by a needle track. Therefore, you are completely safe from this procedure. Keeping in mind the indeterminate nature of the fluid from the cyst it is advisable to go for regular clinical examinations and also do self breast exam once every 15 days and consult your doctor should you have any doubts regarding any new breast lumps. Please do not worry."
