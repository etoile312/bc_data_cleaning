  "Q": "My oncologist told me (when I had surgery for breast cancer) that if I took Arimidex there was a 90% chance the cancer would not recur. If I did not take Arimidex there was an 80% chance the cancer would not recur. I this is true, wouldn t it be better not to take that medicine if the side effects are so severe that they cause other problems that are debilitating.",
  "A": "Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. You have breast cancer and treated by surgery.  You should take criminal.  It reduces the chance of recurrence. Side effects are tolerable.  No major problems occur with it.  So consult your doctor and plan accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health."
