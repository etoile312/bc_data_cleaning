  "A": "Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. You may have multiple enlarged lymph nodes.  It can be due to reactive hyperplasia, tuberculosis, lymphoma or metastatic carcinoma.  You should go for ultrasound study and if needed to go for fine needle aspiration cytology or biopsy of that lump. It will give you exact diagnosis. Then you should take treatment accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health."
