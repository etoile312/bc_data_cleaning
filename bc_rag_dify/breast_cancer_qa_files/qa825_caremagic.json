  "Q": "43 years old had myomectomy on 9/29/10 size referred as 5 months pregnant. Just received results that it was atypical. When I asked what that meant she stated I need to be monitored every 6 months but could not answer when I asked what atypical means she said she is a NP and told me she will have a doctor get back to me. Please advise what this means",
  "A": "His have gone through your description. Bases on that I understood is, there was a lesion in uterus corresponding to size of 5 months pregnant. They resected the lesion of myometrium so called mastectomy. The lesion sent for histopathology to know nature of lesion whether benign or malignant. The report might have mentioned some atypical cells that is cells not benign and showing changes pro Chat Doctor. That means there are not defiantly malignant but suspicious of malignancy .so they might ask you for followup.don't worry. Have regular checkups to know any recurrence of lesion. Thank youRegardsVasundhara"
