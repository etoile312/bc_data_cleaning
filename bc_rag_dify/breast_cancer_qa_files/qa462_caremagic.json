  "A": "Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. You have history of breast cancer. You there are high chance that you have some metastatic breast cancer in your axillary lymph node. Furthermore, you should go for examination. If needed go for biopsy of axillary lymph nodes. Then take treatment accordingly. Hope I have answered your question. If you have any doubts then feel free to ask me. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health."
