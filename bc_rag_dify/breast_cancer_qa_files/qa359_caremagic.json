I am a breast cancer surrvior of 14 years Thank You",
  "A": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your situation and problem. In my opinion you should consult oncologist and get done PET scan. You are survivor of breast cancer with recently detected cutaneous malignant spread. So we need to rule out other organ involvement due to cancer spread. And this can be done by PET scan. This is needed to decide further course of action (treatment). If other organs like liver, bones or lung show malignant lesions then, chemotherapy is needed. So consult oncologist and discuss all these."
