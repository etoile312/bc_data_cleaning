  "Q": "I am 30yrs of age, I live in Abuja(Nigeria) where malaria is the most common form of illness. In 2012 a test was carried out on my blood and I was told that a ring form of plasmodium was found and my sugar level was ok, in early 2013 a similar test was also carried out and I was told tis time that I was affected with malaria and thyphoid, but did not suffer from much of malaria symptoms and I belive thats because i am 0+ and genotype AA. normally after these tests I am always administered with some antimalarial drugs andother relvant prescritions but because of the nature of my job, I am sometimes not frequent in taking them. secondly I am not sure the malaria issue has been properly handled as I still feel a burning sensation under some part of my skin anytime I fast up till 10am and I sometimes experience weakness in my body especially in my legs, this (slight abnormal weakness of the limbs) was worse when I was less than 16yrs of age. then I used to get tired of standing after like 5 to 10minutes. Another issue I really did suffer from since childhood is memory failure. some times like five years ago. pls doctors what should I do?",
  "A": "Dear, I can understand the distress you're suffering from. Here, as I can figure it out, you are having two complaints1) Pain or weakness in legs, more so when after prolonged standing.2) memory problem well, as far the problem of malaria goes, which you mention to have had in 2013 a year back, I suggest you get a complete mammogram test now to check if the problem of malaria still persist. Similarly, get typhoid antibodies tire check by doing Tidal test. This will rule out the possibility of the above two infections. For your problem of leg pain, there could be various reason. It well could be a sequel of these infections, as any illness follows with period of weakness for few weeks at least. Or it could be an independent neurological condition. However, if the pain in legs is very troublesome to an extent where it prevents you from doing your daily routine activities, I strongly suggest you to consult a neurologist. This complaint I your warrant a proper physical examination. For your worry of memory it again requires a battery of question and a details history, which could be possible in personal examination. Hope to have helped you with your query. Thank you. Stay healthy."
