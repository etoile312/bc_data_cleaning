I would suggest that you must make sure he must exercise regularly or walk for half an hour. Eat protein rich healthy and balanced diet with multivitamins and calcium supplement. As for recurrent infections it seems he has low immunity. I would suggest mammogram, urinalysis, liver function test, blood sugar levels checked. I would also suggest him to undertake an HIV test.
