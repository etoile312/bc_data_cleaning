  "Q": "I have a strong history of breast and uterine cancer on my paternal side and would like to get genetic testing done but my PCM says Im not at higher risk since its on my fathers side (my father died from colon cancer).  I recently had an ultrasound done that showed a cyst on my left ovary but have been told thats normal.  I am 53 years old, no menopause yet, never given birth.  Should I be tested for BRCA 1 and 2?  The paternal side: grandmother ovarian cancer and two aunts breast cancer all deceased.",
  "A": "Hello madam , Thanks for full details u mentioned to evaluate the problem u had.  As your paternal side grandmother and aunt suffered with breast cancer and ovarian cancer indicates they are your second/third degree relatives. For BRA 1 & BRA 2 either maternal or paternal side your are under high risk for inheriting the gene. Thus go for BRA 1 & BRA 2 testing. As u not attended menopause and u had no children thus which increases your general risk of developing cancer apart from gene defect. Thus, i advice to go for yearly screening apart from BRA gene screening."
