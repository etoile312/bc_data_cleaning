  "A": "Thanks for your query at Chat Doctor!In my opinion your titles do not show that you have typhoid. To make diagnosis of typhoid by Tidal test at least your title must be more than \"O\">100. So I suggest you get complete mammogram, blood culture, Tidal test (To see rise in title), Malaria test done. Kindly describe your queries so that I can guide. Azithromycin is good option for Typhoid fever. Sometimes patient get diarrhea while on antibiotics. If you are improving no need to worry. Take care!"
