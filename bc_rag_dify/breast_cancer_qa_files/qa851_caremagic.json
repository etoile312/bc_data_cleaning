  "A": "Hello dear. Understand your concern. Its normal dear so don't be panic, because stress induce this side effects of contraceptive pills. Women to women side effects alters little. Mostly OC pills regulate the period, but in some cases in starting 3-4 months period become irregular, so don't worry. Other side effect of contraceptive pills are spotting, nausea,breast tenderness, headache,discomfort, weight gain, mood swings, missed period sometimes, decrease libido means it affects sex Chat Doctor. ...if u want to discontinue this pills, then more many options for contraception are available like hormonal injection, hormonal patch, diaphram, if you have child then u can use copper t... or convince your partner to use condom. Hope this will help you. Best regards."
