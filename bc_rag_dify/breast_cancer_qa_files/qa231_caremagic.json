  "Q": "Hello Dr Thakwani My sister 33 year, unmarried, had undergone treatment for breast cancer right side (surgery & Radiotherapy) in the year 2004 and had a recurrance in the year 2008 in left breast. we got her treated at Tata Hospital Mumbai and her treatment includes chemotherapy followed by surgery, chemo and radiation. She was advised Paclitaxal for chemotherapy and completed her course of treatment in feb 2009. From past one week she is complaining of clear pale yellow discharge from the left nipple (approximately 4-5 teaspoon in a day). She resumed her Menstrual Cycle a couple of months back although not very regular. she is on a rigorous exercise schedule as she gained weight and has a tendency of developing seroma which was once removed and in her follow-up visit doctors advised her to continue with the exercises. In her digital mammography done in jan 2010 the reports were normal. We are worried about this discharge. is this a side-effect of treatment or something really serious? What could be the reason of this discharge (clear/transparent, pale yellow). Please guide. Regards, Aafreen Ameen New Delhi",
  "A": "There are many causes for nipple discharge... Clear yellow colored nipple discharge could indicate a local infection which we call as periodontal mastitis + duct Eurasia. As she is a known dance breast patient and also had recurrence she should definitely be evaluated further with the mammogram of left breast to look for and rule out any abnormality... A few early cancers present with nipple discharge too. But rare. I would suggest left breast mammogram and a clinical consultation at the earliest"
