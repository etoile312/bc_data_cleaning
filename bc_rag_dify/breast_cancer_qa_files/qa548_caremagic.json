  "Q": "Hi, My mother has just been diagonsed with an enlarged liver, she was 34 when she was first diagnosed with breast cancer, that cancer then spread to her whole bone structure, radiationa and chemo theropy kept that under control until 2 years ago when she was diagnosed also with a liver tumor, she went throught strong chemo again and it almost was gone. Now 2 months ago at the age of 47 she has been diagnosed with two brain tumours just abover her spinal cord in the lower lobes, and also her liver is enlarged due to the re - formation of the liver cancer. Is there form of treatment that will help an enlarged liver ? And in your opinon what can we do from here to pro - long her life span and i am 19 years of age with two younger siblings is it best for her to stay at home or go into care?",
  "A": "Hi, Usually liver enlargement may indicate some types of hepatitis or fatty liver diseases and in most cases it doesn't require any specific treatment.  If this is caused by diet, obesity and diabetes then dietary and lifestyle changes will be beneficial in every case.  Alcohol and viral hepatitis are the most common causes and in this case medical evaluation is required.  Also, if there is infectious disease or biliary duct disorders then you need to do some tests to rule out more serious issues which require specific medical treatment. You need to check your viral markers and do liver biopsy if necessary. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Take care "
