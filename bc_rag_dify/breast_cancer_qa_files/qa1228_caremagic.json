  "Q": "I was recently diagnosed with breast  cancer.  DCIS, grade 3, estrogen and progesterpne receptive.  Surgery is scheudled for next week, just a lumectomy.  At the same time I was told to get a biopsy for breast cancer, the surgeon thought my thyroid felt enlarged and ordered an ultrasound which I just had done.  It showed a nodule on my thyroid.  The radiologist recommended a repeat ultrasound in three months.  I have read that breast cancer can spread to the thyroid.  Since my cancer is in situ based on the biopsy, is it still possible it has spread to the thyroid?  Should I be insisting that more testing be done to be sure the nodule isnt cancer or is it OK to wait three months?",
  "A": "Hello, Thanks for your query. You are diagnosed with breast cancer which is estrogen and progesterone receptive (ER and PR positive). This is a good sign. Any breast cancer of size more than 1 cm can spread to other organs. But breast cancer spreads more commonly to liver, ovary (krukenbegs tumor), lungs, bones (vertebra) and brain. You said that you have been diagnosed with a thyroid nodule. The chances of breast cancer being spread to thyroid is very rare. This thyroid nodule might be a different entity. An ultrasound can tell us the nature of the thyroid nodule. To be on the safe side you can get an FNAC of the thyroid nodule which will reveal if it is malignant (cancer) or not. I suggest you to consult your surgeon and discuss regarding the workup of your thyroid nodule. Good luck"
