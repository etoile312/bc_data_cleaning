  "Q": "Yes, had invasive lobular bc, stage one, and right after my double mastectomy , finishing chemo , my original cea marker was 2.5 with tumor in, ca 15-3 was 3, ca 27-29 was 8, ca 125 was 5, ca 19-9 was 26, Now twenty-seven months later, my cea is up to 5.1, ca 15-3 is 10.1, ca 27-29 is 12, ca 125 10 and ca 19-9 gone down to 22. I am very worried with the cea being constantly going up. Had colonoscopy which just showed diverticulosis and a stricture, had pet scan , showed colonic diverticulosis, CT scans no metastic disease so far. All oncologists are very vague. Could I have had the cancer spread via blood not lymph nodes during my surgery while on the table? I think I am not in remission. The cancer is just so small that they can t find it yet on scans. I don t know what other tests I should insist on having?",
  "A": "Hi, it is not clear to me why those markers have been suggested. The more investigations you do the more you will be confused. All the tumor markers have been done and not suggesting any particular diagnosis. Lobular carcinoma invasive has a chance to affect both breasts, this is why it is not like other breast ca like ductal ca. anyway ca 15-3, ca 27-29 has very little role. If any syn Chat Doctor.  But, still, no marker has been raised significantly, even they raise, a lot of non-specific causes are there. So do not worry at all. Keep in touch with oncologist."
