  "A": "Hello, I have gone through your query and understood your concern. Tenderness of the breast is a sign of premenstrual phase as well as an early pregnancy. The breast can also be hard to touch at this stage. You should get a home pregnancy test done with a fresh early morning sample of urine. You can also get an estimation of the serum beta-ChatDoctor titles for an earlier and better clarification. If you are anxious to conceive, in view of your past history of repeated abortions, it is ideal to have an early evaluation. Sucking of the breast leads to release of hormones that may induce uterine contraction and hence are not good for a pregnant uterus. Hope you find this information useful. Take care."
