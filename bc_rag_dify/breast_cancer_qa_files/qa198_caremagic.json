  "Q": "Hi I have a mass about the size of an egg at the crease of my right arm. I saw my GP and he asked me if I was having shortness of breath, chest pains or palpitations. I do have some tightness in my chest with a cough. They are doing a chest x-ray and a mammogram. I am a 52. They have also scheduled me to see a general surgeon regarding the mass. Can you tell me if they are trying to rule out NHL or Hodgkins? Thank you.",
  "A": "Hi, thank you for asking Chat Doctor. A lump at the crease of your arm could be a swollen lymph node which is an indication that something could be wrong somewhere. Considering your age, it is important to rule out a breast tumor or other tumors in your chest. Your appointment with the general surgeon would probably be to remove the lump for a biopsy. Hodgkin's diseases or Non Hodgkin Lymphoma could be one of the possible causes of this, but I think they would want to rule out a malignant breast tumor first. I hope that helps wish you well"
