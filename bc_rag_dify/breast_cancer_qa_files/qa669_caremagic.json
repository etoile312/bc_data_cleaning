  "A": "Hello and welcome to Chat Doctor, A lump in the breast needs to be investigated. A breast lump can be benign or malignant. However, the have mentioned that the lump is at the junction of neck and chest. This lump could be arising from breast tissue or arising from the soft tissue of the chest. A clinical assessment needs to be done. Whatever be the location of the lump an aspiration cytology of the lesion needs to be done. In aspiration cytology, the cells are aspirated from the swelling, spread on glass slide and stained with appropriate stains. This investigation will determine the origin and nature of the lesion. Management can be done after getting the results of the investigations. Thanks and take care Chat Doctor. "
