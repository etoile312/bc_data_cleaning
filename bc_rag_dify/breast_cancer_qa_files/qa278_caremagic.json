  "A": "Hi, PCOD is a multi-symptom disease that causes irregular or absent ovulation accompanied by multiple follicular cysts of the ovary, obesity, hirsutism, acne, insulin resistance and infertility. It is basically a disturbed pattern of the hypothalamo-pituitary-ovarian axis. It has a very good response to proper management. As your cycles are steadied you may be induced for ovulation with proper monitoring and this would give you good results. You may need Metformin also along with induction; tubal patency also needs to be tested before initiating treatment. Take folic acid. Please be positive as POD has a very good response to treatment and follow your doctors instructions. Good luck."
