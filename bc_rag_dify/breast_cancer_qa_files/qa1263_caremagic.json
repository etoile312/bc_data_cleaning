  "Q": "hi i am 26years old i have three children and just the last day or so i have noticed a lump attached to my nipple and its in my nipple, its a different colour to the rest of the nipple. at first i thought it was dry discharge so i tried to pull it out and now it really hurts as its obviously attached. i also have one on my left nipple too but its not as big,, i dont have any history in my family of breast cancer but im very worried about this. any indications as to what this could be? it doesnt really hurt or anything but my breasts do feel larger too the last few days...thanks",
  "A": "Welcome to Chat Doctor I am Chat Doctor and I will help you with your query have gone through Question. It appears to be papilloma of the nipple. It's a not a breast carcinoma as presentation of breast Ca is quite different. Its treatment is simple and complete. If such a patient walks into my clinic I offer him two options. One, excision with a tiny disc of skin and the other one is tying the base of the papilloma, and it will fall off spontaneously in few days. I hope my answer will help you with your query. Do rate it, If you like it. Regards"
