  "A": "Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern.  Symptoms of breast cancer are breast lump, pain, discharge from nipple etc. You should go for mammography and if needed then go for biopsy.  You may have fibrotic disease or cancer.  Consult your doctor and take treatment according to cause. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health."
