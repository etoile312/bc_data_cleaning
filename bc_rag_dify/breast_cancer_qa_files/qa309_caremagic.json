  "Q": "MY DAUGHTER HAS ALL THE SYMPTOMS OF BREAST CANCER BUT DOES T HAVE ANY HEALTH INSURANCE AND IT DOWN TO ONE DAY A WEEK AT HER PRESENT JOB. SO SHE NEEDS SOMETHING REALLY CHEAP OR FREE. WE LIVE IN ALABAMA. SHE REALLY NEEDS TO BE CHECKED OUT. CAN YOU HELP HER?",
  "A": "Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern.First she should go for fine needle aspiration cytology or biopsy to confirm the diagnosis. Treatment depends on stage of cancer. She should go for mammography also. If it is cancer then she should take chemotherapy. Then she should go for surgery. Modified radical mastectomy with lymph node dissection is the treatment of choice for surgery. She should also go for her ER, PR and Herne status. If these receptors are positive then receptor antagonist therapy is helpful. Consult your doctor and plan accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have any doubts then contact me at bit.ly/ Chat Doctor. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health."
