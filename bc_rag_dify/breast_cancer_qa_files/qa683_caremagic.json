  "Q": "My mother was diagnosed with early stage breast cancer in January 2012. She had a lumpectomy and finished her radiation treatments at the end of June. In May, doctors found a spot turn up on her liver via a CT scan and MRI. They didn t seem to concerned about it. My mother just got back blood test results and it indicates her liver enzymes are high (57 AST, I think) and over the course of several years, they have steadily increased to this level. Between the May and present blood tests, her Liver enzymes have doubled. I should note that she has been on symvastatin for about two years, to treat high blood pressure. Should we be concerned about anything specific? Is there any addtional information we can give the doctor that might shed some more light on the enzymes being elevated?",
  "A": "Your mother can do blood for Alkaline Phosphatase, bilirubin , and gamma Gautama trandspeptidase. These are increased in liver metastasis. She can also do blood for hemoglobin and albumin which are decreased in this condition. CT scan of upper abdomen with contrast needs to be done. If liver space occupying lesions are found then ultrasound guided FNAC or biopsy is suggested to prove liver metastasis that is spread from primary breast cancer. Clinically patients develop jaundice, ASCIIs, hepatomegaly, tenderness, cathexis and sometimes fever. Regards and Take care"
