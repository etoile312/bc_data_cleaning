  "Q": "Hi I went and seen a dr. today about lumps in my breast! I had a mammogram and ultrasound back in June of 2012 and it says multiple masses in the right and left breast with the largest one being 4 cm in size likely representing fibroadenosis plus bilateral masses seen largest is 3 cm...is this something to be concerned with as it could be cancerous???",
  "A": "Hi and welcome to Chat Doctor. Thank you for your quarry. No, there is a minor possibility that this is cancerous. This is typical finding of fibroadenomas. Such enlarged cancers would cause much more intensive symptoms. Usually ultrasound can evaluate with high sensitivity is this malignant. If you want to be sure, biopsy can be performed but i don't think this is necessary. Just do frequent follow-ups and everything will be fine.Wish you good health."
