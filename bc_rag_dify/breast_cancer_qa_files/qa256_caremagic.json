  "Q": "Hi On Tuesday I had a mammogram and an ultrasound and two biopsies on a lump in my breast . The consultant has told me from this and the shape of the lump that it is cancer and that when I go back next week for the results of the biopsy they will discuss treatment but will be having an op to remove lump in breast and lymph nodes from my armpit. Just before leaving I told her that I had a lump behind my left ear on the boney part and she said I should have mentioned it but she will look next week. The lump is in my right breast. Do you think this is of concern ie that it has spread? I am obviously panicking and it would help me to at least get through the weekend knowing either way as next week is a lot of sleepless nights away worrying",
  "A": "HelloWelcome to Chat Doctor It is good that you underwent biopsy for breast lump. It will give you definitive diagnosis and if it is breast cancer it can be treated with modern surgery/radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Regarding lump behind ear; there are retro-auricular lymph nodes in that area. It is commonly enlarged when there is infection in scalp. It is very rare to have swelling in that are with breast cancer. Although a simple test Fine needle aspiration biopsy will give you the answer that whether it is due to cancer or not. Regrads"
