  "A": "Thanks for your query at Chat Doctor! Your \"O\" title is = 1:100 and \"AH\"= 1:160 which suggest that you probably are suffering from Typhoid fever/Paratyphoid A fever. I would like to know had you received TAB vaccine in recent past? You have not mentioned your symptoms? Based on symptoms you can start antibiotics like Ciprofloxacin/Azithromycin for 10-14 days after getting prescribed by a local physician. I suggest confirming your diagnosis you must repeat the test after 15 days to see rise in \"titles\" which will confirm your diagnosis. There is nothing serious it is completely curable. You can get other tests done like mammogram, blood culture, Typhoon test to be completely sure. Take care!"
