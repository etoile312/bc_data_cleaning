  "Q": "I have a lump in my armpit with a dull ache and a weird feeling in the breast nearest that armpit. I had bleeding from this same breast and a biopsy several years ago but they did not find anything? I have a doctors appt in a week but kind of scared and concerned?",
  "A": "Hello! Thank you for the query. Armpit is where lymph nodes are located. So any lump in this location should be checked with possible enlarged lymph node. Enlarged lymph node can appear due to breast cancer. This is the worst (and less probable) possibility. Other, more possible reason is an abscess due to infected hair follicle. Pain indicates such lump. Abscess should be incised and Chat Doctor. In case of lymph nodes enlargement possibility ultrasound should be done and biopsy considered. Hope this will help. Regards."
