  "Q": "My name is Cynthia and I have question about cancer, I have an aunt who has just passed away from cancer.  She had just came from getting her yearly mammogram but three weeks later they found 32 cancer tumors in her brain and she also had breast cancer.  how could this have happen?  I am terrified because now it seems like I have not a headache put pressure on my head. please tell me its all in my head.",
  "A": "Hi Cynthia ! I do understand your concern. She might be having a small focus of residual cancer not noticeable in the MRI, which gave rise to metastases in the brain. As you are related to her, it is natural to be frightened. I would advise you to get control over your emotions, and at the same time consult your doctor for a screening mammogram for you and the time period of further follow-ups. Wishing you all the best."
