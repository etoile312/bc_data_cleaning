  "Q": "Um will I get breast cancer if I remove the hairs at my armpits?  I only need to remove it once for my ballet examination and I dun wanna do it again as ppl always told me about the cause of breast cancer.  Yea I havent done it but I may need to do it once.  Yea I also know that many women shave it many times but I just feel insecure.  Will it cause breast cancer?  Is it save to remove them?  If its ok, any suggestions for HOW?  (I think i can choose not to shave, but it will be better if I do so.)",
  "A": "Hello welcome to Chat Doctor Regarding your complaint it is entirely MIS concept that shaving underarm pits cause breast cancer. Risk factors for breast cancer are old age, female sex, no breastfeeding to the born baby, no child bearing....Don't worry about the breast cancer,it will not occur because of shaving. There is no problem in shaving armpits.continue that but keep in mind that after shaving don't apply deodorant or any moisturizer, as it cause irritation to sensitive skin. Hope you understand my suggestionThank you Chat Doctor. "
