  "Q": "I already had a mammogram done and also went back for additional views for the right breast. Im  scheduled to have a Ultrasound on my right breast .I was told that there is a 8mm nodule on the chest wall . I had calcifications removed 6yrs ago. I have not a clue what may have caused a nodule to appear on the chest wall. If it is a cyst or  worse. Can the nodule be surgically removed ?",
  "A": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. Yes, this nodule can be removed surgically. You should definitely get done ultrasound examination of breasts. This will give you more idea about nodule size, shape, margins, association with surrounding areas etc. All these are important in diagnosis of the nodule whether malignant or benign. Since you are having history of calcification in the past, possibility of benign nodule is more. And yes, you can definitely do excision Biopsy (surgery) of that nodule to remove it. Don't worry, you will be alright. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks."
