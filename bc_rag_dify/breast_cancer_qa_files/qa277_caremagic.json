  "A": "Hello, Your symptoms could be related to a sinus infection or chronic inflammation. For this reason, I recommend performing a sinus X-ray study and some blood lab tests (complete blood count, PCR, ESR, coagulation tests). An abdominal ultrasound would help investigate for possible causes underlying pelvic pain. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Wishing you good health. "
