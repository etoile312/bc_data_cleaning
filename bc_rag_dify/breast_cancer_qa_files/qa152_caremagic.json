  "A": "Hi Kristen, Welcome to Chat Doctor Forum. Do you have associated cough, fever or weight loss? Do you breast pain? Maybe it is an Enlarged Lymph Node. But it has to be examined by a Physician and a Gynecologist. Get your Chest and Breast examined to rule out any underlying Pathology. If it is changing in size and shape, it may be sent for biopsy, and you will be evaluated Further. Wish you Good Health."
