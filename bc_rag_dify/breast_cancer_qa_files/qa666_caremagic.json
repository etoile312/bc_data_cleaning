  "Q": "Hello. I have what my family doctor has stated in the past calcium deposits on my arms. He told me not to worry because they are solid and not fluid like. Tonight I found one on my scalp. Location is above my left ear. I am a female age 57. I had a complete hysterectomy in November of 2013; however, I had the bumps on my arms prior to that surgery. This was my only surgery. I am not taking estrogen (no medications at all). I have regular mammograms and usually need to get a 2nd one due to density of breasts. I have my annual one scheduled for next Friday. Should I be concerned about this new lump? Thank you. Vikki",
  "A": "Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. You may have some cyst or soft tissue tumor or skin adnexal tumor. You should go for fine needle aspiration cytology or biopsy of that lump. It will give you exact diagnosis. Then you should take treatment accordingly. Don't worry go for examination at the time of annual check up and plan accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have any doubts then contact me at bit.ly/ Chat Doctor. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health."
