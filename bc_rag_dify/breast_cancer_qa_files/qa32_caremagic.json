  "Q": "I read that gastritis may be masking a case of ovarian cancer. It was a recent article but I dont remember where. My wifes mother died from ovarian cancer. She has one sister (out of 3) who has had breast cancer twice. Christina, my wife has had gastritis for months now. Her doctor performed endoscopy and found everything appears normal. Christinas gynecologist performed an exam including ultrasound over 2 years ago and found nothing unusual. What are the chances of Christina having ovarian cancer? Shouldnt she have a complete exam at least once a year? Medicare wont pay for more than once every 2 years. Is there a good blood marker for ovarian cancer besides CA125? Thanks!!   ...Ron",
  "A": "Hi, Thanks for writing in. Gastritis is inflammation of the mucosa of stomach in reaction to increased amount of acid formation. It is unlikely for gastritis to be responsible for ovarian cancer. However, if there is cancer ovary in her family then your wife might do an ovarian cancer tumor marker test. There is a blood test called CA 125 which is a cancer marker test for ovarian cancer. This is a simple test and tells a possibility of cancer in the ovary. This is not related to gastritis. Doing this test once a year will benefit her. Please do not worry."
