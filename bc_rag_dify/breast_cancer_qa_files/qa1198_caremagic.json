  "Q": "Hi. So I ve had unprotected sex on February 24th and a few times before. I am on the depo shot and have been having bubbles in my stomach and stomach pain. I ve had headaches and I ve been bleeding for about 3 1/2 weeks. Spotting sometimes and sometimes like its my period. Also my sides have been hurting when I breathe.
