  "Q": "Hi I ve been on nuvaring for a month and a half now after ring free week I put the ring back in on Friday like I was supposed to however I was having vaginal burning and itching which I later found out was a yeast infection. Not knowing what the symptoms were I took out the ring on Saturday and put it back in on Sunday 5 days later I had unprotected sex is there a possibility that I could get pregnant. I know when you first start the ring you have to wait 7 days however I had the ring in for a month and used it exactly as directed so I figured I was still protected even though I took it out that one day. & now its been 5 days since the unprotected sex and i m having cramping and breast tenderness. This happened last month when my original period was supposed to come before I started nuvaring. Is this normal or could I be pregnant its to early to take test",
  "A": "Hi there, Th effectiveness of Nova ring is hampered if removed from vagina for more than three hours. Since you had removed it for a day, in the first week of the cycle it is possible that the hormonal suppression that needs to occur due to Nova ring might have been affected and caused to have ovulation to occur in this cycle. So yes its possible that you could be pregnant. You should test for pregnancy, 28 days after your previous period. As if pregnancy has occurred it is likely to show by then. Have you taken adequate treatment for the yeast infection? Hope this helps. Regards."
