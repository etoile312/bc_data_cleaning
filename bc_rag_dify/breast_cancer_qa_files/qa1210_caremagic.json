  "A": "Hello and welcome to Chat Doctor I would keep a possibility of fungal infection. Closely abutting body folds e.g. finger webs, upper inner thighs, groin, maxilla, submammary folds etc. can trap sweat, heat and moisture, therefore making the area favorable for fungal proliferation. If I was the treating doctor I would have asked you to use a topical antifungal like either clotrimazole OR ketoconazole OR fluconazole cream, twice daily, regularly for 4 weeks. One such cream that you can use is Candid-B cream, twice daily for 4 weeks. For the thigh and groin area. I would also suggest an oral antifungal e.g. fluconazole 150 mg once weekly for 4-6 weeks for a more complete cure OR you can use terminating 250 mg tablet once daily for 4 weeks. An OTC antihistamine e.g. cetirizine 10 mg once daily would help you in symptomatic itch relief. An Antifungal dusting powder e.g. clotrimazole dusting powder can also be used throughout the summers, it would not only keep the folds Chat Doctor. General measures like loose fitting clothes, bathing twice during summers, weight loss and checking for blood sugar levels etc. go a long way in providing relief from recurrent fungal infection regards"
