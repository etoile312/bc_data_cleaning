  "Q": "Hi, I am 25 years old. In january I took depo for the first time. Almost immediately after I began experiencing something like pre-menstrual cramps. Since about mid february I have been alternating between bleeding and having a brown discharge. Also, my breast have been very tender and I find myself very exhausted. I have discontinued the depo. What is happening to me!?",
  "A": "Hi. Thanks for asking in Chat Doctor. You are experiencing the side effect of depot preparation. Depot me Chat Doctor.  Progesterone can also result in breast tenderness, abdominal cramps, bloating and depression. It will take some more time for your periods to get regularized, although you have discontinued depot preparation. Do not worry. Your symptoms will subside slowly in due course of time when the after effects of progesterone depot preparation wanes off.  If they continue in the same manner even after 2 months, you should consult a gynecologist and get examined thoroughly. I hope this is useful to you."
