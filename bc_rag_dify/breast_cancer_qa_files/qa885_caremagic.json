  "Q": "I have what my doctor and myself assume is cyclical axillary pain related to my menstrual cycle (worse pain closer to menstruation). There is also a small lump that increases and decreases in size. I had a clear mammogram two months ago, just prior to last gyno appt. This month, the pain is causing radiating pain down my arm from axilla to palmar forearm and up into anterior neck (SCM, anterior fibers of upper trap). I would describe as a nerve pain, aching.",
  "A": "Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. You have benign breast lesion like fibroadenomas.  Cyclical pain with menstruation and change in size is common in fibroadenomas.  No need to worry. Just consult your doctor and go for excision. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health."
