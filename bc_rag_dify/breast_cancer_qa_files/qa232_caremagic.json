  "A": "Hi. Thanks for your query. All the symptoms looks to be related to the hormonal changes associated with ovarian dysfunction, which in turn may be due to other problems. The changes of breast, late periods, mood changes, nausea, can all related to the hormonal changes and may be enhanced by the anemia. I would advise :Gynecologists opinionUltrasonographyHormonal assayControl of the stress and anxietyTreatment for the symptoms."
