  "A": "Hi, I read your query and can understand the distress you must be having due to your symptoms. From what you have mentioned, it seems that you are suffering from a depressive episode. Feeling low and anxious, sleep and appetite disturbances, getting tired easily are symptoms of depression. However, some of these symptoms as well as depression itself can be result of hypothyroidism as well. I would recommend that you seek a psychiatric consultation for complete evaluation and initiating treatment. Blood investigations in form of thyroid profile and complete mammogram would be required to rule out any underlying medical condition. You would treatment with anti-depressants for your depressive symptoms.  Other than medications, you should also start exercising daily, as that will help you feel relaxed. Best wishes for a speedy recovery."
