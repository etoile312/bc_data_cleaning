  "Q": "Here goes...last period was July 28th and no period at all in August. I began spotting on Sept. 7th and 8th and only had brownish/pink when I wiped and have had light vaginal bleeding but have not needed to use any type of tampon/pad and nothing on my pantyliner at all. Again, I only seen when I wiped. As of now, I have nothing at all. I am 37 yrs old and this is not the normal for me as I have a very regular period....always! My period is usually a day early or late. I am very sexually active with my boyfriend and no, we do not use protection at all. I have had some pregnancy symptoms as far as fatigue, headaches, tender breast, nausea w/o throwing up, etc. My previous pregnancy I never had any type of morning sickness so not sure what s going on w/me? What do you think?!",
  "A": "HI, Thanks for the query.  I understand your concern.  Delayed period with symptoms like nausea/ vomiting/ breast tenderness, in fertile age first possibility is pregnancy. Confirmatory test for pregnancy is pregnancy test of urine / blood & USG pelvis after 5 weeks of pregnancy.  * I would advise for either of the pregnancy confirmation/ exclusion test first.  * In case pregnancy is -ve, investigations for finding cause of menstrual irregularity(Thyroid problem/ ovarian problem/ POD/ fibroid uterus) & specific treatment after that with a gynecologist advise.  Thanks."
