  "Q": "I have a small red lump on my right breast, looks like a bug bite. It has been there for about 10 days. It has not changed. It does not hurt or itch. It has never developed a center like a pimple. Should I worry about this? I am 59 years old, moderately overweight, and no family history of breast cancer.",
  "A": "Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. You may have some acute inflammatory lesion.  However, you should go for fine needle aspiration cytology of that lump to rule out malignancy.  Consult your doctor and plan accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health."
