  "Q": "about 3 days ago I noticed a lump on my  upper, middle chest, pretty well above my right breast. It is non moving and hard. There is no pain or tenderness upon touching it, It feels as big as 1-1 1/2 inches, and about the size of 2 quarters stacked.I am a 21 year old female. I smoke very rarely, about a pack a month. Dont drink or do drugs. I take prescribed percocet as needed for back pain (1 or 2 10mg pills every day). I exercise regularly and eat healthy though I am slightly overweight since i suffer from PCOS and hyper and hyper thyroid. I also suffer from fibromyalgia I just went to the doctor today due to the fact that I have been sick for around 3 days ( I noticed the lump when I started feeling sick)  The P.A had no bedside manner and didnt even tell me the diagnosis however, from past experience, this feels like an Upper Respiratory Infection since the cough, pleghm, everything are mostly in my chest. I dont know if any of this information is even relevant but i figured I would put it down in case you need it.I just want to know if this could possibly have anything to do with my sickness or possibly my fibromyalgia. Or is this something I should be worried about? Also, if it is something worrisome, what kind of doctor would I see?Thank you so much!",
  "A": "Hi.it is best if you consult with a doctor, preferably a general surgeon, for medical and physical examination. Based from your description, it could be a cyst, a fibrous, a fibrotic lesion or other breast tumors. These lesions are best evaluated clinically. Further diagnostic examinations, such as breast ultrasound, mammography and tissue diagnosis or biopsy, will be requested as needed. Regular breast examination and follow-up with your doctor is highly recommended in these cases.  Management (medical and/or surgical) will be directed accordingly. Hope this helps. Good day!!~ Chat Doctor. "
