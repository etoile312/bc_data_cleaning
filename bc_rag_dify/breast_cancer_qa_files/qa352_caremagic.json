  "Q": "hi i am 25 from last week i am feeling a little bit pain in my right breast, just below the armpit. After a week when i crosschecked i xould feel a small hard lump inside the breast and the pain is from that area only. can you please suggest me what should i do?",
  "A": "Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. You have breast lump with pain. You may have fibroadenoma, fibroadenomas or fibrotic disease or some other mass lesion.  Furthermore, you should go for fine needle aspiration cytology or biopsy and mammography.  It will give you exact diagnosis. Then you should take treatment accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health."
