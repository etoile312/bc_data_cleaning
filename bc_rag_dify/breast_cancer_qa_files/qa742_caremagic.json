  "Q": "my daughter has breast cancer and is taking chemo treatments. Her white cells are normal this week but her platelets are low. She had 2 pints of blood last Wednesday and was supposed to have her chemo today, but they said no because of the platelets. is there anything she can do or take to help keep her platelets normal.",
  "A": "Hi and thank you so much for this query. I am so sorry to hear about the breast cancer your daughter is battling with. Really, chemotherapy suppresses the production of these cells alongside red blood and white blood cells. This makes it difficult to maintain the numbers. The best way is to transfuse platelets concentrate to increase the numbers. I hope this ad Chat Doctor.
