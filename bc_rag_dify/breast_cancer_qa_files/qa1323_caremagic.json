  "Q": "Wondering why my breasts are so very very tender? Just had my period @ the end of last month. I just recently had the fluid drained from my spine. Would that have anything to do with it. My back is also hurting badly, I ve taken Motrin & pain meds nothing is easing the pain. Plz help.",
  "A": "Howell come to ChatDoctorThank for asking a question your query being appreciated, if this is the bilateral mammary gland tenderness then it may be due to hormone changes, pregnancy need to be ruled out too, else it may not be the disease or anything wrong with the breast itself, no need to treat the condition soon it will come around, if the single breast is involved then it could be due to infection, and then it will be mattered of concern, abscess need could be the cause, I would suggest treating the pain with Tab Ibuprofen 400 mg three times in day, in case of abscess formation may need surgical intervention hope this information helps."
