  "Q": "I have been on Anastrozole since late 2012 for breast cancer. Last summer a nodule formed on top of my toe. It was surgically removed. 2 months ago a nodule,causing trigger finger formed at the base of my inner left thumb. I m in hand therapy for and had a cortisone shot.Yesterday I noticed a nodule at the 2nd joint of my right index finger. Could these nodules be a side effect of my medication? It seems suspicious that 3 have developed in such a short time.",
  "A": "HIT hank for asking to ChatDoctorI really appreciate your concern, the nodules that you have on your fingers are not because of the breast lesion or the medicine that you are taking for the breast malignancy, when you have first removed the nodules then this should have sent for histopathology, the finger lesion could be something else and that need to be examined properly keeping in mind the history of malignancy, take care and have nice day."
