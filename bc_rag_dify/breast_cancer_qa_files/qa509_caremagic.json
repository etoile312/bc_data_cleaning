  "Q": "my dentist prescribed Triamcinolone to treat a sore down the center of my tongue.  I put some on a q-tip but it does not stick to the area.  I did not rub it as the directions said not to or it will get gritty.   It just came off on the ruff of my mouth.I have been taking Anastrozole after Breast Cancer surgery and inter-Beam radiation.  Could this medication be causing the problem with my tongue?",
  "A": "Hello and welcome. Thanks for sharing your concern. After reading your complete history posted, here it appears that the soreness of your tongue is not related to Anastrazole or to the radiation beam therapy.Therefore, you can apply Triamcinolone on the affected area of tongue and watch for a week. The symptoms should subside, if not you can go for clinical evaluation and if required a small biopsy to exactly diagnose the cause. Hope it helps. Thanks. Take care."
