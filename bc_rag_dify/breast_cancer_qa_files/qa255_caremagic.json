  "Q": "I have been experiencing severe, 8-9 on pain scale, over my entire body.  I was diagnosed w/ fibro 20 years ago, and this is not my \"normal\" fibro pain.  My neck, shoulders, lower back into my buttocks, outer hips, hands, feet and toes, thighs are all involved in this severe pain.  I also have a lump on my posterior left breast.  Scheduled for a mammogram this week.  I am also extremely fatigued.  I just fall asleep and these episodes last anywhere from 5 minutes to several hours.",
  "A": "Respected user, HiT hanks for using Chat Doctor.come have evaluated your query thoroughly.* Painful breast lump may be inflammatory lesion most likely as fibroadenomas or other tumors.* General body symptoms are in relation with altered internal homeostasis either from hormonal imbalance of other systemic issue needs to be evaluated in depth. Hope this clears your query. Welcome for further guidance. Regards."
