  "Q": "Yes please, I have been experiencing some pain in my under arm/armpits, especially here lately the left one and can be quite uncomfortable! This has been occurring for about a year but I have had no insurance, I attempted to call to try & get a mammogram done but couldnt find a facility that would help me out due to the county that I had been living in. Ive have noticed a bit more swelling in the underarm area, maybe its the lymph nodes not sure. I recently got insurance but waiting on my insurance cards to arrive however the pain has really increased on the left underarm, wondering if I should just go on to the ER?! Sherry Rios  THANKS!",
  "A": "Hello, sherryThank you for consulting Chat Doctor. As you are having pain and swelling you need to have mammogram for sure. Fibroadenoma may cause pain if it is compressing some servers under it and as it is benign and can be removed surgically no need to worry about it much. But if it is a malignant condition then you need to be worried about but for now Romany treatments were introduced to cure it so nothing to be worried much. And if there is any local infection also the lymph nodes may enlarge and may be tender too. Abscess may also be the cause, but you will know that by seeing as it looks red externally and hot to touch with severe pain. Thank you."
