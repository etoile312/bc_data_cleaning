  "Q": "my wife went to cardiolgist was told to go for catherization fo possible bloc. she just went thruoh breast cancer surgery and radiation. she says shes done with dr and will not go. she feels that there is no blocage and its from radiaton what can i do",
  "A": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. No, you should make her convince fir coronary angiography (catheterization). Her routine ECG and other reports must have shown possible blockage in heart vessels. If untreated, these blocks can be fatal and life-threatening. So without taking any chances, I advise you to convince her for angiography. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wishing good health to your wife. Thanks."
