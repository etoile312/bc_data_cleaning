  "Q": "My Mother is 85 years old and my Father told me this morning when she went to the bathroom she her stool was black, dark. She is a two-time breast cancer survivor and it being evaluated for dementia. Should I try to get her in tomorrow (Monday) to her primary care or wait to see if it continues to be black. She lives in an Assisted Living Facility, should I have them notify the Head Nurse at the Facility first?",
