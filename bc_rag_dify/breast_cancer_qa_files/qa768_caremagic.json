  "Q": "my tongue swells up at night. It has been going on for some time.  But last night I had a burning sensation that kept me awake.  My upper pallette is affected also.  I suffer from long term heartburne also, are these related.  I am a 15 year survivor of breast cancer.",
  "A": "Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query. The swelling over the tongue could be because of the growth secondary to chronic irritation. It can be fibrous or hyperplastic candidiasis or fissure tongue. The burning sensation could be because of the fissure tongue. On the palate the lesion could be a kissing lesion that is spread of candida infection from the tongue to the palate region because of contact of tongue with palate. Consult an oral physician for further management. You can use topical antifungal like candid mouth paint and topical analgesic and anesthetic like Anabel gel. I hope my answer will help you. Take care."
