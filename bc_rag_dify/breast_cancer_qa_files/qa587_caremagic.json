  "Q": "Soon I will be cancer free for 2 years after chemo for breast cancer. I love to walk briskly for exercise. However, I notice that after walking a block or two my legs begin to feel very heavy and tired & as a result ,my walking feels very labored and uncomfortable. No more brisk walking. I am 70 years old and feel quite healthy otherwise. No medications.",
  "A": "Hi, Thanks for writing in. Good to know that you have conquered cancer and won your battle against it. Chemotherapy has helped you a lot and made you cancer free. Chemotherapy medicines are strong and might cause a number of side effects that includes nerve damage. This is known as peripheral neuropathy and I guess that you hare having symptoms of peripheral neuropathy. Unfortunately this might become a chronic condition in many patients, and they have to take medications to feel better and make their lives comfortable. There are medicines to help in peripheral neuropathy and I suggest you consult your neurologist and get your condition confirmed and take medicines. Please do not worry."
