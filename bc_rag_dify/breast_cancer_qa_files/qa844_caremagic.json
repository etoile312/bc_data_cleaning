  "Q": "I am a inflammatory breast cancer survivor, a few months ago I had a few severe dizzy spells, and have had prolonged sinus issue..left maxillary , cheek are is numb and feels clogged.  Nasal membranes have been inflamed...just finished a five day steroid regime along with an antibiotic and allergy meds.   Still feel the numbness, no drainage or other symptoms....worried about mets from my IBC cancer to nasal area....should I be concerned.   I think it has been about 3 mos since first sinus issue",
  "A": "Hi, Thanks for writing in. Treating breast cancer with chemotherapy is done by giving many medicines which are strong and powerful. These medicines also require steroids to be given. Many patients experience lowered immunity as a result of these medicines and subsequently might have inflammation and infection. It is possible that you have developed inflammatory sinusitis and this can be treated symptomatically with over the counter decongestants. However since you have the symptoms for 3 months therefore please get a clinical opinion from the ENT specialist and confirm any infection due to your lowered immunity which might require treatment. Please do not worry."
