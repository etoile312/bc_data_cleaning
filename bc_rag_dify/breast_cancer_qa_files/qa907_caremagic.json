  "Q": "My mum aged 60 suffered a major stroke which has left her right side paralysed and lost the use of her speech. She can say a few words but has adapted wonderfully. Lives on her own with the help of carers calling 4 times a day. Has a happy enough quality of life. She has just found a 2 cm hard lump in her left breast. She has been referred to the breast clinic for tests next week. I am really worried if it is cancer what lies ahead? Would treatment for a stroke victim be possible ? I dont wont her to loose the quality of life she has at the moment. ?",
  "A": "Hi and welcome to Chat Doctor. It isn't usual to discover breast cancer in this age. Also, most lumps are benign(95%), usually adenoids which very rarely become malignant. Lump can be evaluated by ultrasounds and biopsy, but considering her condition I think this isn't something that should worry you right now. It can't be harmful and dangerous for her life. The most important now is to facilitate her recovery from stroke. Wish you good health and good luck."
