  "Q": "I did a mamograph and it came clear but did an ultrasound and my doctor tells me that they found a lump lymfod under my armpit and have asked to do another ultrasound in two months? my question is, does this mean I have cancer and at what stage? pls advise",
  "A": "Lump in the arm pit could be due to many causes mostly infection or benign lesions. However, it is important to rule out secondary enlargement of lymph nodes from breast cancer. If you are in the high risk group like family history of breast cancer/ obese/ multiparous then It's important to rule out carcinoma breast. Since your mammogram is clear not to bother, repeat a scan according to your doctors advise, or get a cytological examination done and if you notice a lump in the breast, hard and fixed, do consult your doctor immediately. Hope this helpsRegards"
