  "Q": "Hi Doctor,I usually have sex every 20 days but my husband doesn`t want me to get pregnant and neither does he like to use Condoms, so he asks me to have contraceptive after the night we had sex. I had been practising this almost a year.I want you to tell me whether this would lead me to some serious or long term side effect?",
  "A": "Welcome to Chat Doctor, You have been using Emergency contraceptive pill after having sex. Emergency pill are to be used only occasionally as a back-up method to prevent pregnancy as they have higher does of hormones which have side effects such as altered menstrual cycle, vaginal bleeding, vomiting, stomach pain, breast tenderness etc. As you have sex once in 20 days, a condom is the best contraceptive for you. If still your husband is not agreeing to a condom then you can take regular Oral contraceptive pills which have to be taken regularly. Hope that answers your question.  Chat Doctor. "
