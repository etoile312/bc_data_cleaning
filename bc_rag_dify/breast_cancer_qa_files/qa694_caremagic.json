  "Q": "Hi. I had something that looked like a pimple on my breast. It was bothering me, so I squeezed it. When I did, a waxy, white discharge with the consistency of bread came out. My breasts are also very tender. I recently had a mammogram, and the doctor said that everything was normal. My mom recently died of breast cancer, and I am concerned.What could this be? Is this something to worry about?",
  "A": "Hi there, I understand your concern. Your symptoms are not suggestive of cancer and your mammography is also normal, so chances of breast cancer are unlikely. It could be some form of local infection for which you can consult your physician who may prescribe you anti-inflammatory, and antibiotics if needed. Hope this answers your query. If you have additional questions or follow-up queries then please do not hesitate in writing to us. I will be happy to answer your queries. Wishing you good health. Chat Doctor. "
