  "Q": "I am 48 years old. I had a mammogram 6 months ago. Showed a spot on right breast- had an ultrasound. It was a cyst. The cyst went way after a few months. My physician also diagnosed me with Fibrocystic Breast changes. Just finished my period and it had been 2 weeks late. I had a lot of soreness/tenderness in both breasts/nipples. That s when I discovered a lump deep in center under left armpit. It feels sore and uncomfortable at times. Doesn t feel hard. I still have the lump in my armpit and my breasts are still sore even though my period is done. Should I wait to see doctor or could this be cancer?",
  "A": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. You are having axillary lymph node.  This can be due to either infection or malignancy. In my opinion you should first get done mammography of breast and ultrasound of maxilla. If lymph node can be biopsied easily than get done biopsy from node. If this is negative for malignancy than no need to worry much. Post menopause hormonal changes are quite common.  So these changes can cause soreness in breast. So get done biopsy from the axillary swelling and rule out malignancy."
