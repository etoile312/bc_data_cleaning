  "A": "Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. You have history of breast cancer. You should go for removal of that fluid filled breast lump and histopathological examination. Furthermore, you should go for this surgery to rule out and residual tumor cells or recurrence. Consult your doctor and plan accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have any doubts then contact me at bit.ly/ Chat Doctor. Thanks for using Chat Doctor.
