  "Q": "I am 5 8, I weigh 129, and I am 17 years old. I recently started being sexually active, and I have had people in my family with cancer. For example, my grandmother on my dads side has breast cancer . My grandfather has skin cancer on the same side. In the past 3 days, I have noticed my nipple on my left breast has been sore, and feels like dry skin is on it. It s rough. Is this a possibility of cancer?",
  "A": "Hi and welcome to Chat Doctor. Thanks for the query. You are too young to think about cancer. Your breast changes occur due to hormonal changes and this is commonly seen in your age. Few more years are necessary for hormonal stabilization, so you may feel such problems in the future. Also, later in life(+35) you should do frequent breast check-ups considering your family history.  Wish you good health. Regards"
