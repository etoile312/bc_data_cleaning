  "Q": "I HAVE HEADACHAES EVERY MORNING WHEN I AWAKE. I HAD A MRI OF THE BRAIN AND RESULTS WERE NEGATIVE. IT IS BEGINNING TO EFFECT MY ENERGY LEVEL, I AM IRRITABLE, INPATIENT, AND MOST OF ALL DO NOT FEEL GOOD. MY OTHER HEALTH ISSUES INCLUDE TYPE 2 DIABETIC; MY THYROID WAS REMOVED IN JUNE. THE PATHOLOGY REPORT SHOW CANCER CELLS IN STAGE 1. MY DIABETIC CIA IS 6.7. I HAVE TRIED DIFFERENT PLLOWS AND THAT DID NOT HELP. I AM AFRAID THE DOCTORS ARE OVERLOOKING SOMETHING. I HAVE ALSO HAD BREAST CANCER (23 YEARS AGO). I KNOW THAT I AM MORE PRONE TO BRAIN AND COLON CANCER DUE TO THE FACT THAT I HAD BREAST CANCER. I JUST WANT TO WAKE UP WITHOUT HEADACHES.",
  "A": "Hello, Since you've had CT and MRI, you can't say that your doctors have overlooked something, MRI is the most sensitive exam to detect brain lesions (including cancer, whether primary or metastases). So they seem to have done, all in their power to make sure there isn't any lesion responsible for the headaches. So I think medication for headache prevention is necessary. Amitriptyline would be the more obvious choice. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. "
