  "Q": "I was diagnosed with stage 3 breast cancer in 2002. Had lumpectomy lymph nodes does positive. I do not have a dr at this time but my affected breast is enlarged, sore and sounds funny but itches. Do you think this is something I sould worry about? as all mammograms have always come back clear.",
  "A": "Hi, Thanks for writing in. It appears that you might have a fungal skin infection on the under side of the breast. A clinical examination is required to know if the itching is accompanied by fungal skin changes. The commonest infection is ring worm, and it occurs in the under side of breast where there is sweating and moisture deposition. This might not be related to breast tissue and therefore the mammogram comes normal. The treatment for breast fungal infection is application of antifungal treatment and wearing cotton inner clothes that will prevent sweat formation. If the ointment does not work in a confirmed fungal infection then a short course of oral antifungal medicine might be taken. Avoid scratching the area of breast where it is itching. Please do not worry."
