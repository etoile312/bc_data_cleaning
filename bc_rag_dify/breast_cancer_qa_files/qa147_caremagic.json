  "Q": "I ve been told I have a calcium deposit on my rib - I had a mammogram as thought it was a lump on my breast. Recently I have felt quite short of breath and think I may have asthma or just suffering from hay fever. Also sometimes when I have a sharp intake of breath it sounds like there s a noise from the lump??",
  "A": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your situation and problem. By your history and description, possibility of bronchitis is more. Asthma is allergic disease, and mostly it is seen from long time like since childhood. You are having recent onset breathlessness, so possibility of asthma is less and possibility of bronchitis is more. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test). You may need inhaled bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS). So better to first diagnose yourself and then start appropriate treatment. Don't worry, you will be alright. Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health. Thanks."
