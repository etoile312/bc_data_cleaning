  "Q": "Had single mastectomy 2 weeks ago for Pagets disease with an underlying tumor that was also removed. It was 1.3cx0.9x0.8 cm. and sentinel node biopsy showed one benign. The cancer is Stage 0a and is Triple Negative. How should this be treated// I am currently undergoing tissue expansion for reconstruction!",
  "A": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. Stage 0a cancer of breast needs surgical resection of tumor nodule and dissection of involved lymph nodes. So you had absolutely right treatment. So no need to worry much. Pagets disease of breast has high incidence of recurrence.  So in future if you find any nodule or swelling in breast (opposite or same) than you have to get done biopsy of it. No harm in reconstruction surgery. Eat healthy and stay feet for prevention of malignancy."
