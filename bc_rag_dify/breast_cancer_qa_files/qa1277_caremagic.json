  "Q": "I am taking letrozole for almost 3 months now after my mastectomy as I was diagnosed with Stage 1 breast cancer. I have bleeding in my gums, several times a day, even as I wake up and I gargle  there are blood clots which means I have bleeding gums even while asleep. What does this mean? Thank you",
  "A": "Hi. Welcome to Chat Doctor. I read your query. Metronome is actually a hormonal therapy used for blood cancer in post menopausal women. Among its other effects are vaginal bleeding and gum bleeding. You need to consult your physician if you can have some change in medicine (which is highly unlikely). Maintain good oral hygiene. Brush twice daily using extra soft brush and toothpaste with tannin acid. Take healthy diet with iron, vitamin C. Ask your physician for multivitamin and mineral supplants for you. Use mouthwash twice a day. Rinse well after eating. Visit your dentist every 3-6 months and get oral prophylaxis regularly. Massage gums with a mild gum paint or mustard oil for healthy circulation. Hope the answer helps you. Thank you!"
