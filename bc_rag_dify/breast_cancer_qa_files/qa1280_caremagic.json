  "Q": "My younger sister has just been diagnosed with Lymphoma and feels that she does not want to have anymore of the Cancer treatments available,bcos she had breast cancer in both breasts twenty two years ago,and has been in total remission for close on eighteen years now,so she knows the rigors of the treatments available.Is there any alternative therapies that can help her through this present condition. There are ten of us girls and all but myself has had breast cancer.We have lost 4 of my older sisters to breast cancer and the rest are all still in Remission,through self treating themselves,the same way our mother,our grand mother, aunts,and grand aunts did,back in the 1935 s up til 2002. Our mother had double breast cancer,when my baby brother was born,she was then aged 49,and he was her 24th child.I am number 19 of those 24 children.Our mother had 3 sets of triples and 2 sets of twins,of which I am of her last set of triplets. However my mother,self-treated herself too after being diagnosed,and she died at the age of 96 yrs. She lived long enough to raise her children,but also to bury 4 daughters,who told her that her methods of treating diseases had gone out with Noah s Arch,and buried 6 sons who died all serving as SAS service men, in the Armed Forces,for NZ,Australia and UK.!! My sister with the lymphoma is 62yrs old and has been caring for her husband who has been on dialysis for the past ten years now,but was diagnosed with diabeties 6 years prior to being put on dialysis.This is our plea for help for her.",
  "A": "Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. Your sister has lymphoma.  Treatment depends on type and stage of lymphoma.  Overall treatment of choice.  Chemotherapy and radiotherapy.  She should go for immunohistochemistry to confirm the exact type.  Then she should take treatment accordingly.
