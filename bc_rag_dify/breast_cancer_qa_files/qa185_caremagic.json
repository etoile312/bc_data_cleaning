  "Q": "I went into my PCP for a routine physical and the C-reactive protein blood test that they did came back @ 77.  Dr. then ordered a mammogram, addl blood tests including repeated CRP, thyroid anti-body check, ESR & CBC with diff.  I was told that those tests came out fine except the CRP was still high.  After some thought, I was called today and told that Im being referred to a Rheumatologist.  With the exception of a pulled shoulder muscle, Im not having any symptoms.  Any thoughts?",
  "A": "Hi, dear. I have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. You have very high CRP. You may have some inflammatory connective tissue disease.  Furthermore, you should consult rheumatologist and go for complete ANA profile.  Then you should take treatment accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health."
