  "Q": "Hello, my daughter is 18 months and she is diagnosed with mastocytoma. she had a single lesion on her leg; with a biopsy she was diagnosed with mastocytoma.  Bloodwork show she has elevated platelet count of 407 and calcium of 10.7 mg/dL.  what does this mean... please help me",
  "A": "Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern.  She has mastectomy. Her blood work for platelet count and calcium is normal.  She should go for surgery.  Surgical removal of the lump is treatment of choice.  Consult your doctor and take treatment accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health."
