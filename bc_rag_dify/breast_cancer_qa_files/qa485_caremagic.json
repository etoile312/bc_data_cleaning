  "Q": "I have been taking Lutera birth control pills for almost 3 months now and this is the first time this has happened. I had my period about a week ago (8/23-8/30) and I m still bleeding , except it s a sticky/chunky, thick black colored blood , almost black! Is this normal? If it keeps going on, should I see my doctor and change BC?",
  "A": "Hi, thank you for your query. What you are experiencing are the classic side effects of Luther birth control.a lot of women experience Vaginal bleeding between periods (spotting) or missed/irregular periods may occur, especially during the first 4-5 months of use. This along with clots, passage of dark-colored blood is seen. There may be associated nausea, vomiting, headache, stomach cramping/bloating, dizziness, vaginal discomfort/irritation, increased vaginal fluids, or breast tenderness/enlargement.I would advise you to consult your OB/GUN to change the birth control method to a more suitable one. Thank you, wishing you good health"
