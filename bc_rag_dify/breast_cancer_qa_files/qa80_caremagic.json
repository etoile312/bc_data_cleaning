  "Q": "I have got breast cancer, my lymph nodes are clear from the armpit as this was checked when I had the lumpectomy, I have this aching pain in back of my knee, although the sports injury man said it is pulled hamstrings, and I have no lump or swelling, could it have spread to the knee if my lymph nodes are clear in armpit",
  "A": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your situation and problem. I also think that your knee pain is mostly due to muscular injury.  No need to worry much for cancer spread. Breast cancer tend Mohave bone metastases.  So bones are common site for breast cancer spread. Most commonly involved bone is vertebrae and long bones like femur. Joint involvement is very uncommon.  So no need to worry. But better to rule out this fear by doing ultrasound examination of joint. If this is normal than your pain is mostly due to muscular cause.  So take good painkiller and muscle relaxant."
