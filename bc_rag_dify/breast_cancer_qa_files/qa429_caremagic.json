  "Q": "I was diagnosed with stage 1 breast cancer in 2009 and I have been on Tamoxifen since I had surgery. When I started Tamoxifen, I was  premenopausal (age 44), but my periods became irregular. Just found out that I have a large endometrial polyp. Obviously, I am now concerned about the possibility of endometrial cancer. How should I follow up?",
  "A": "Hello welcome to Chat Doctor For your breast cancer you are using tamoxifen since surgery,Tamoxifen is used in the treatment of estrogen receptor positive breast cancer. But that tamoxifen has side effects like it causes endometrial polyp, endometrial hyperplasia and endometrial cancer. Endometrial polyp causes slight bleeding.some polyps are carcinogenic.so better consult Gynecologist and remove it by simple curettage.and the removed mass send to histopathology. If cancerous cells are present then you have to undergo hysterectomy that is complete removal of uterus...as you are near menopause so no problems. Hope you understand my suggestionThank you Chat Doctor. "
