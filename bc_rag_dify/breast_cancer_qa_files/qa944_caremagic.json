  "Q": "In the last month I noticed a dent about 4 inches long developing in the top rear of my skull runningvertically down toward the nape of my neck.  I am 76 years old,  I walk 3-5 miles a day in good weather.  I try to eat well.  I do have permanent lung damage to my right lung due to radiation from breast cancer 16 years ago.  But I never had such a seam on my skull.  It aches a bit especially when I get tired and seems to be more painful on the right side of my skull.  How should I have it checked?",
  "A": "Hi, Thank you for posting your query.First, I would like to reassure you that there is no need to worry about the dent, as most often, dents are not serious. Since, you have a mild ache, it may be better to get clinically examined by a neurologist, and if needed, a CT scan of the brain may be done to exclude any pressure on the underlying brain due to the dent. If the CT scan is normal, then, no further treatment is necessary. I hope my answer helps. Please get back if you have any follow-up queries or if you require any additional information. Wishing you good health, Chat Doctor. Ly/"
