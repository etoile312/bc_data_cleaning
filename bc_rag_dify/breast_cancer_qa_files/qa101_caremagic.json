  "Q": "I have  swelling under my arm about 3  to 3 1/2 inches around, this is the second time in approx 6 months, I had a mammogram which showed nothing - however this time is it painful and sore to the touch and movement -when I move my arm there is a pulling sensation and pain - the first lump was there for apppox a month = this one has now been there for 3 weeks..... there is no redness or \"warmth/heat\", but the pain is the difference, should I be concerned...I have no fever or other specific symptoms, I am tired but is more likely to be attributed to lack of sleep and my hours.......",
  "A": "Hi. The swelling under the arm which is not hot is called a cold abscess, meaning lymph node mas due to tuberculosis. I would advise you to get an ultrasonography and guided FNAC - fine needle aspiration cytology to confirm the diagnosis, as also blood tests like Gold Quantifier test for TB, X-ray chest PA view. If this is diagnosed as Tb, get started with proper treatment to get a cure with preliminary liver function tests. You will be fine. IF the FNAC shows cancer so the treatment will be as per the guidance of oncosurgeon and oncologist."
