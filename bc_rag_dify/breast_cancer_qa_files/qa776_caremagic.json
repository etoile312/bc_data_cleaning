  "Q": "My sister 3 years ago had breast cancer in 1 breast - was treated had her 2 breasts removed, - the 2nd breast just as a precaution.  4 months ago her scans and everything were clean/clear.  Last month they said it was back - 4 spots on liver, 1 on pelvic bone, 1 spot on rib bone and 2 spots on spine so they have said its most likely in the bones.  What will be her chances of living through this.  Today is her 2nd chemo treatment again.  3 wks  on chemo (once a week for 3 wks) and 1 wk off for the next 3 or 4 months theyve said.  Please tell me anything you can. She is 54, about 160 lbs. and has rarely been sick in her life other than this cancer!  Sincerely, Marilyn Morgan",
  "A": "You did not mention whether she took any chemo or radiotherapy after the surgery. Anyway, now it is stage 4 breast cancer and is quite unlikely to get completely cured. The treatment that has been prescribed to you appears to be correct, and should go ahead with it. This will prolong her life and make it more comfortable. If her hormone receptors are positive (ask your doctor), then she should start on hormone therapy (tablet therapy) after completing chemotherapy."
