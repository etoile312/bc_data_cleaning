  "Q": "Ok here it goes.....3 days ago I found three lumps in my right breast.  Two are small, pea-size, then there is this huge lump(one each day).  The entire lower quadrant! It is warm to touch, the veins are prominent in my areola, my nipple is sticking further out not in which is good I think.  Went to a clinic today, and she gave me antibiotics to try.  So all is good but it is so excruciatingly painful, Im starting to get pretty concerned.   Should I be?  Ive searched and searched and all I can find similar is cancer or abcess?  Any suggestions?  Im not pregnant, nor have I had children.",
  "A": "Hi.based from your description, it could possibly be a cyst, a fibrous (fibrous tissue formation) or fibrotic changes of the breast, which are all benign breast lesions. Malignancy must also be ruled-out. It is best if you consult with a doctor, preferably a general surgeon, for clinical evaluation. Diagnostics such as breast ultrasound and mammography may be recommended. Management (medical and/or surgical) will be directed accordingly. Hope this helps. Good day!!~ Chat Doctor. "
