  "Q": "83 year old woman with locally advanced breast cancer.Diagnosed 2006.Tamoxifen given and was effective  for 6 years.Since then two other hormonal therapies have been given without success.The doctor has said chemotherapy i s not an option but will give radiation therapy .In addition to radiation are there any other options which can be given.Should hormonal therapy be tried again.",
  "A": "Hi and welcome to Chat Doctor, thank you for your query. There are 4 possible treatment methods, surgery,chemo, radio and hormonal therapy. Surgery is obviously not an option. Unfortunately it seems like there wasn't good reaction on hormonal and chemo as well. So radiation is the last option and honestly, success rate is not very positive. If hormonal therapy was successful once, it probably won't be successful if done again since it means that this is not cancer estrogen dependent. I hope that radio will show good results. Wish you good health. Regards."
