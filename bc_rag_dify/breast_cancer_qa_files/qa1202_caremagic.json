  "Q": "Ultra sound of left kidney- midpole left renal cyst. The renal cortex has increased bilaterally. Increased echogenicity of the renal cortex suggests underlying chronic kidney disease. All I was told by nurse was to watch my blood pressure. Should I see a specialist?Thank you!",
  "A": "HelloThanks for query. Your ultrasound Scanning has revealed increased echogenicity of renal cortex on both side . Increased echogenicity of renal cortex is suggestive of Chronic Renal Parenchymal disease . You need to consult qualified Nephrologist for clinical examination and get following basic tests done to assess the grade of kidney disease .1) Mammogram 2) Urine routine and culture with 24 hours excretion of proteins in urine 3) Renal function tests like Blood urea and Serum creatinine Further tests if required and treatment will depend upon the findings of these test and final diagnosis.
