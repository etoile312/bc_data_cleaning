I can t shake the feeling that in pregnant have not takin a test what should I do.",
  "A": "Hello madam, from the history you have given, well IRENA contains levonorgestrel, which is a progesterone hormone which can cause side effects like nausea, breast tenderness, sometimes abdominal discomfort, break through bleeding. But as the symptoms get worsen, I would suggest you to consult your gynecologist for a check-up to be sure that IRENA is in its proper position. The chances of pregnancy with IRENA in situ in its normal position is very less. Hope I was helpful to you."
