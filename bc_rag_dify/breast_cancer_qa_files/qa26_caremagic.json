  "Q": "I had breast pain so when I was scanned I was told l have fibroadenoma. The doctors said I will be operated but on reaching the theatre they discovered that the lump was big and suspects cancer. So I was not operated. The doctor recommended some drugs for me to use which are Evening Primrose Oil Softgels, baume Leopard and clofenac. To be taken for 2 weeks. This is exactly one week and am feeling a tremor in my legs and hands.",
  "A": "HelloWelcome to Chat Doctor. For evaluation of any breast lump ;the standard recommendation is to undergo triple evaluation. It includes clinical examination, imaging(mammogram/ultrasonogram) and needle biopsy. If you have breast lump, and it is suspicious according to your doctor, it is better to get fine needle aspiration biopsy which gives you definite diagnosis whether it is cancer or not. Tremor in legal and arms does not seem related to your breast lump. Regards"
