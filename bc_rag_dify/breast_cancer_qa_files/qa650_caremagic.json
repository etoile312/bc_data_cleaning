  "Q": "Hi. I have be diagnosed with MM and also going on now is one of my breast has a golf ball size mass and a very large bruise on it. this all showed up within 12 hours or so..this was 3 days ago. Now I have noticed a skin tag looking growth on my nipple of the same breast with clear discharge. I m 52 years old, female. Do you have any idea what this could be? It really itches, the bruising and mass are from 6 o clock to 9 o clock. Got any ideas?",
  "A": "Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. You have multiple myeloma.  Your breast lump may be due to some cyst or inflammatory lesion like acute or granulators mastitis.  However, chances of breast cancer are also there.  You should go for mammography and fine needle aspiration cytology or true cut biopsy of that lump.  It will give you exact diagnosis. Then you should take treatment accordingly. For multiple myeloma you should continue your treatment AA prescribed.  Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health."
