  "A": "Hi, Endometrial hyperplasia and hypertrophy is somewhat different anyway the exact histopathological diagnosis is preferable. Estrogen plays a role in endometrial hyperplasia. Breast cancer patient should have an annual gynecological check up to rule out the same. The clinical trials like ATC, ATLAS has reported about it. But chance of malignancy is less. So you should better follow the normal breast cancer follow-up protocol."
