Last night afterpmoandger dinner she was is more pain than I have seen her in, stating it was also in her back. I have stage 4 breast cancer, no other cancers in our family",
  "A": "Hi, dear she may have some liver disease or gall stone or something else.  Chances of pancreatic cancer is very low.  She should go for ultrasound abdomen or ct scan abdomen.  It will give you exact diagnosis whether the has pancreatic cancer pr other pathology. Then she should take treatment accordingly.  In early stage treatment is surgery.  In later stage chemotherapy like gemcitabin should be given.  Consult your doctor and take treatment accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health."
