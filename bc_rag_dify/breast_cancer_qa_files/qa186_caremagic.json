  "Q": "I had breast cancer eighteen years ago; consequently I had a lumpectomy followed by chemotherapy and radiotherapy. A year ago I was diagnosed with D.C.I.S. in the same breast, I had this breast removed in July. Last week I had my regular blood test; these tests were not because of cancer. However the results indicate that I have high glucose levels. Does this mean that I might have cancer in another part of my body?",
  "A": "Hi. Raised plasma glucose level does NOT indicate cancer at some site. It shows that you may have diabetes mellitus. Do you have a family history of Diabetes Mellitus? Was it a first reading of raised plasma glucose level? How high was the plasma glucose level from upper limit and was it fasting or random levels? If it's the first time a raise in plasma glucose levels is observed, I would suggest that you have your fasting plasma glucose levels (after at least 10 hours fast) repeated. If it is raised have your serum located hemoglobin levels (serum HbA1c levels) done which will give your plasma glucose control for last 3 months and discuss with a dietitian and your doctor for dietary recommendation and medication (if required)I hope it helps. I would be happy to answer any further questions if any."
