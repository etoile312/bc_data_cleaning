  "Q": "Hello. I have a low grade fever, 100.07 last time I checked, and a headache. No other symptoms. During the summer of last year a similar occurrence happened. They though perhaps lyme but were not ever able to prove it.When I wake I typically covered in so much sweet I need to change the bed sheets and shower.",
  "A": "Thank you for your query....first answer me a few questions-how old are you?do you have cough with fever?do you have chills and rigor with fever?does the fever remain throughout the day or for some time only?where do you live?kindly provide these information so that I can move further towards the diagnosis...anyway as of now this can be because of simple viral fever which is most common....however diseases like tuberculosis, malaria, dengue etc. can be the cause...Lyme can be another one of the causes....however for that, you need to undergo specific tests...as of now, take tab paracetamol 500 twice daily for 5 days get a complete mammogram of blood done consult a general physician contact me with the reports....hope this was helpful...regards"
