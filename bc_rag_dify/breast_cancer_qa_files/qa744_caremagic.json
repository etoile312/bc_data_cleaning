  "A": "Welcome to Chat Doctor .1. No Your symptoms are not related to breast cancer - periodic lumpy feeling, related to the periods.2. The symptoms more related to the ductal Eurasia / dilatation (hormonal related)3. In this case if you are my patient, after the examination - in terms of lump. After that order for an ultrasound breast - to evaluate the nature of the lump, its source and its extensions. 4.
