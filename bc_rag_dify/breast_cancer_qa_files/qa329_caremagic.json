  "Q": "Im 18 years old and a mother. About two months ago I felt a bump on my breast. My doctor told me to wait until i got my period. It never came so i had to take pills in order to get it but the bump is still there and the doctor insist it doesnt feels serious. What could it be",
  "A": "Hi, Dear,Good Morning. Thanks for the query to my Chat Doctor online-clinic. I studied your query in-depth. In my opinion your doctor is right and keep faith on him. Your breast lump is -a Fibroadenomas of Breast-along with? Fibroadenomatous Nodule. This comes up due to the genetic familial hesitance and is basically due to the hormonal breast tissue changes, which in some cases take a shape of Lump, which is not harmful. Alerts/ Warning for couple consult your doctor if the lump increases in size. For that Self examination of the Breast is the Advice from me. Hope this would resolve your worry-some query. Wellcome again to Chat Doctor. Have a good day."
