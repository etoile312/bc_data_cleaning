  "Q": "I have found a round moveable lump the size of a large pea near the nipple.  I have also had the mirena coil fitted about 7 weeks ago.  The lump is not painful, but i have been experiencing low level soreness/pain around the breast.  I am seeing the doctor today but am quite worried.  I am 34 and have had two children.  no history of breast cancer",
  "A": "Hello.  Lumps over the breast can be due to several reasons, but the majority of lumps is due to the female hormones (estrogen).  Most lumps are still benign, however, to rule it out a complete breast exam, plus an ultrasound will help the physician to see whether your lump needs a biopsy or not.  Personally, i don't request a mammogram for patients who are low risk under 40y/o, hence an ultrasound will suffice for now."
