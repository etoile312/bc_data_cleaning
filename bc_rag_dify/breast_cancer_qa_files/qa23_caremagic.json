Please help!!",
  "A": "Hello! Thank you for the query. Please note that any surgery is an immense effort for whole organism. We can compare it to taking part in car accident for example. So this is a typical reaction for surgery. Your body needs to rest to get back to normal. It takes time and It's hard to accelerate it. So if you do not feel any part of your body weaker (like one leg or arm is weaker), no headache, no dizziness and pale skin, your heart rate is lower than 100, rest is all you need. If any of mentioned symptoms is present, you should consult your doctor right away as stroke or anemia are possible. Hope this will help. Regards."
