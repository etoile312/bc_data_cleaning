  "Q": "I had both breast removed last year due to breast cancer on the right side. I am now getting a sharp pain that comes and goes on the right side in my chest . Is this normal. The pain is very sharp and repeats itself for a couple of minutes at a time, the will stop for while.",
  "A": "Hi, Thanks for writing in. There are many nerves under the skin in the chest and breast region. Irritation of any such nerve can cause sharp frequent low intensity pains in the region which repeat at short intervals. The nerves also supply underlying muscles in the area. Please take careful note of how and when the pain starts, does it happen on its own or is it precipitated by doing an action like lifting objects or bending down. If it is related to such an event then please take care to do it slowly. You can also apply pain relief gel or spray to the painful area when it first happens and this will keep you comfortable for some time and prevent recurrence of pain. Please do not worry."
