  "Q": "I am a 2 yr breast cancer survivor and have started following the Metabolic typing diet and lifestyle. The coach I m working with is advising me to start taking Pregnenolone drops to help lower testosterone levels and to help raise my estradiol , estriol and progesterone levels and licorice root drops to lower high cortisol levels. I have read some contraindications regarding breast cancer history and these 2 supplements. My breast cancer was not hormone positive. He says it is a bunch of garbage. I plan to ask my oncologist when I see her next but wondering what your take on this is?",
  "A": "First, in breast cancer, we want to keep the estradiol levels low as they cause the growth of any remaining cancer cells in the body. Secondly, this is applicable only to hormone positive cancer. So whatever effect your diet is going to have on your hormones, it is not going to affect your cancer control since you have a hormone negative cancer. I assure you it is not garbage but the result of years of research by dedicated scientists the world over. As far as a healthy diet plan is concerned, you just need to avoid obesity as it is the only proven factor for breast cancer occurrence. Also, take adequate amount of fresh fruits in your diet."
