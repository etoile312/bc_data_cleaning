  "Q": "hi, I have been experiencing tenderness to my breast area 12 day after i had my period, and started having sore throat issues, along with a white creamy discharge . My tenderness to my breast is still their and I m 6 days away from my cycle, and I haven t been able to concieve since 2007, What do you think these symptoms mean? Might I be pregnant? I had I.U.D. placed in after my last pregnancy but it was difficult to have them remove the I.U.D. after 2 years on being implanted inside me. I had to be put to sleep to get it taking out because it hurt so much it made me cry. After that I have been unable to get pregnant this far.",
  "A": "Hi, Breast tenderness could be due to the water logging post-ovulation. Sore throat could be seasonal. You can get a blood test done to be sure about any chance of getting pregnant as Hits at this stage may not always give a positive result as they are not so sensitive. Ideally, you should wait for your period before taking the next step. If you have failed to conceive after removal of IUD, and that too with difficulty, you should get investigated for secondary infertility, including uterine condition, patency of the tubes and so on. Please get further advice from your doctor. Good luck."
