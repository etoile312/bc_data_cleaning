  "A": "Dear Alimchale, I am sorry to note that your mother has stage 4 breast cancer. This is supposed to be a terminal stage. But even in this stage if she gets palliative management she will have good time. Since I do not have the full details about the type of cancer she has so cannot comment what medicines she should have. In this condition also she can be administered some growth restraining medicines, Chat Doctor.  You should consult your Oncophysician who will rightly guide you about the best palliation. I wish for her good time ahead. Truly,"
