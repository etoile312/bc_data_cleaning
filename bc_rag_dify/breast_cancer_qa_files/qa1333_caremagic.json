  "Q": "I am a 72 year old male. I am active. As I was walking this afternoon I felt something uncomfortable in my groin area,. When I returned home, I looked in this area and see a bright red area about 2 or 3 inches long. It is sore to the touch. It has an odor. I put zink oxide on it and plan on cleaning the area well when I shower tonight. I do not wear boxer shorts.",
  "A": "Hello and welcome to Chat Doctor I would keep a possibility of Intertwine, which is inflammation of the body folds. There is superimposed candida infection in most cases (Candida Intertwine). Clinically intertwine presents as red, moist, scaly patches of skin on closely opposed body folds. Closely opposing body folds e.g. finger webs, thighs/groin, maxilla, submammary folds etc. can trap sweat, heat and moisture, therefore making the area prone to Intertwine. If I was the treating doctor I would have asked to use a topical antifungal like clotrimazole/ketoconazole/fluconazole cream, twice daily, regularly for 4 weeks. An OTC antihistamine e.g. cetirizine spy, once daily would help in symptomatic itch relief. An Antifungal dusting powder e.g. clotrimazole dusting powder, would not only keep the area Chat Doctor. Regards"
