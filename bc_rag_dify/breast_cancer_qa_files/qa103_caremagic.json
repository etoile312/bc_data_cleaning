  "Q": "Hello, I have extreme pain in right lower jaw. I had an x-ray two weeks ago at my dentist and it was normal. My primary care physician was wondering about TN and ordered lab work to check on infection or inflammation.The pain is constant and sharp. thank you",
  "A": "Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query. The pain in the lower jaw could be because of many reasons, since you are telling radiographs revealed nothing. The other possible cause of pain could be arising from the temporomandibular joint disorders or mastectomy muscle disorder, or it can be neurological disorders(trigeminal neuralgia). We have to rule out these causes, and then we can treat accordingly. Consult a good oral physician and get it evaluated. I hope my answer will help you, take care."
