  "A": "Hi, Thanks for the query. As you are having irregular periods it is difficult to guess the time of ovulation. So though you are having some symptoms of pregnancy just by them, we cannot confirm or rule out the pregnancy. As some other conditions as you told PCs etc. can present with this kind of symptoms. So you once consult gynecologist, get examined and go for ultrasound. By this the chance of pregnancy can be rule out and also the possible cause for your amenorrhea can be made out.
