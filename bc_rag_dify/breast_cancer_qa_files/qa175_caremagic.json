  "A": "Hi, Dear Thanks for the query to Chat Doctor virtual Clinic. I studied your query with available details given in your query. I understood your health concerns. Cause of the armpit lump with Cough-AS your breast on USG study showed normal, the bilateral lymphadenopathy in maxilla/armpit, could be due to -Pulmonary TB with general debility or With Hodgkin's Lymphoma/or NHL. Update more information-of accompanied malaise, fever,joint pains, and any weight loss lately with this cough and armpit lumps.Hence, I would advise you to Consult ER Surgeon /Onco-Physician, who would investigate it by-CBC(Complete Blood Test) with ESR, IGRA (Interferon Gamma Release Test -to find out any evidence of old or current TB infection in the body. X-ray Chest, FNAC Biopsy with HPR study of the armpit lump, would confirm the nature of the lumps and cause of the accompanied Cough with it. So Don't worry till you get the FNAC Biopsy of the armpit lumps, to rule out other causes of such a lump. So consult an ER Surgeon.Don't Self-treat or medicate in your case as the case may go in to further complications. Hope this reply would resolve your query and would help you to plan treatment with your doctor. Hope this would relieve of your health concerns. Welcome for any further query in this regard before final suggestions are given in your query. Wishing you fast recovery. Have a good day. Chat Doctor. N. Senior Surgical Specialist."
