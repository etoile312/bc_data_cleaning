  "Q": "Unexplained swelling in lower legs and ankles. Have changed blood pressure med to one that has a dieuritic but it has has no effect. Am a 2-time breast cancer survivor (1987 and 1996, two mastectomies, no chemo or radiation) and a minor stroke in 2000.",
  "A": "Hi, Swelling in lower limbs can be a side effect of some antihypertensive medications like Calcium Channel Blockers which include Amlodipine, Cilnidipine. So check if you are taking any of these. Also get your echo done to see for any heart dysfunction which can also cause swelling in lower limbs. Other abnormalities that can cause it include gout for which you have to test your uric acid. Cancer breast and post mastectomy won't cause lower limb swelling. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Thanks,"
