  "A": "Hello, Welcome Thanks for consulting Chat Doctor, I have gone through your query, as you have yellowish saliva don't worry this happens when there is problem of poor oral hygiene or poor digestion also. You do proper brushing twice daily. Use tongue cleaner to clean your tongue daily.  Do warm saline gargle two - three times a day Use chlorhexidine mouthwash twice daily.  Take one capsule vitamin B complex once daily for 7 days Consult dentist and go for Scaling and root planning.  If then your problem continues then consult physician for examination and complete mammogram if necessary. Hope this will help you."
