  "A": "Hi, Yes, you need to mention it on your next visit as it may be related as a medicine side effects. He will examination your knee for any secondary spread of cancer (the chances are very low) and change the medication (if the findings are negative) that you are currently taking. Meanwhile, you can take ice packs, mild form of exercise like knee press, active knee movements and slow walking will provide some relief till your next visit. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further."
