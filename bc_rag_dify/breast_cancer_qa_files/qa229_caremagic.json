  "A": "Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. You may have benign proliferative breast lesion like fibroadenoma or fibrotic disease or rarely breast cancer.  You should go for mammography and biopsy of that lump. It will give you exact diagnosis. Then you should take treatment accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health."
