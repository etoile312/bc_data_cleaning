  "A": "Hello Ana! Thank you for asking on Chat Doctor! I read your question carefully and understand your concern. Your performed tests can exclude any possible cardiac disorders, column disorders, aorta disorder related to your symptomatology. So if the gastroenterologist excludes possible implications of endoscopic findings (small hiatal hernia, reflux, gastritis) in your symptoms, the most probable diagnosis would remain a Costco Chat Doctor.  This is inflammation of the ribs and sternum joint. I recommend performing a complete blood count and inflammation tests (fibrinogen, sedimentation rate, PCR) besides a physical examination. This disorder usually recovers spontaneously. But painkillers are helpful, due to their anti-inflammatory effect. Regarding your stomach problem, I would recommend trying suppository of indomethacione, diclofenac or ibuprofen, which avoid gastritis exacerbation. Hope to have been of help! Best wishes, "
