  "Q": "Hi, im 13 and a girl. Im worried , one of my breasts, my right one, is seeming to get different. My great grandmother had breast cancer, so I look out for these types of things. The shape of my nipple is changing, ive read that it could be a sign for breast cancer. Half of it is longer and more oval looking than the bottom, which is wide and circular. So it looks like 2 dent on each side to make it more clear, I just noticed it while doing a self evaluation.",
  "A": "Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum.  It appears to be your hyperactivity, now it is the time for you to think of the studies, exams, and games, snacks, and foods.  Around the age of monarchy, the breasts will develop in a different stage, and different sizes in both sides.  Leave about all these things, and if you have any doubt about the health you ask your mother.  Take more of green leafy vegetables, pulses, sprouts, and protein rich foods, to have good health resistance against the infections.  Wishing for a quick and complete recovery. Thank you."
