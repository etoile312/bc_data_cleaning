  "Q": "Hi I have been diagnosed with bronchiectasis since 2008 when I underwent a thorecotomy and decortation of a pleural effusion . I also had 2 diagnosed breast cancer which eventually required a mastectom. I have had numerous chest infections from pnemonia and recently an e-coli infection. I have been in intensive care twice since 2008 with pnemonia and septisis. I now have lymphoema and my abdomen/stomach is swelling up and doesnt seem to be getting better even though I have water tablets. My GP believes it could be caused through gasping for breath creating air and bloating . What would you advise?",
  "A": "Hi, you had breast cancer, and it was treated. So the abdomen/stomach swelling/distention may also be caused by accumulation of fluid in the abdomen called as ascites. So you need to have clinical examination by a physician/oncologist to rule out the same or by ultrasound abdomen. If there is free fluid in abdomen it needs evacuation, fluid analysis to rule out relapse of cancer. Massive accumulation of fluid can cause gasping for breath and bloating. The other possibility is called as dyspepsia which requires evaluation with investigations and treatment Hope I have answered your question"
