  "Q": "My friend was receiving chemo during stage 4 of breast cancer. Living with her son, they were instructed to not get pregnant. His wife found out that she was already pregnant. His mother died 6 wks before their baby was born. Living in denial, they had him tested 4 months ago & he is 3 yrs old with autism. Is this a direct result of living with a chemo patient during pregnancy?",
  "A": "The exact cause of autism is not known, but research has pointed to several factors: genetics (heredity); metabolic or neurological factors, certain types of infections, and problems occurring at birth. In your child, environmental factors may also play a role. Studies of scientists have found abnormalities in several regions of the brain, which suggest that autism results from a disruption of early brain development while still developing in the mothers' womb. Other autism theories suggest:- immune theory -antibodies that attack the brains, causing autism.- abnormalities in brain structures cause autistic behave- abnormal timing of the growth of their brains.  I want to propose you 1 thing-check his blood for It B6,B12, Folic acid, homocystein. I had positive results with treatment child Chat Doctor. "
