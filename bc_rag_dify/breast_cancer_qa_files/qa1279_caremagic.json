  "Q": "Hello, I am a 44 year old female. Long story sorry. 2 years ago I started having ache in my left breast - Nurse practitioner said a swollen lymph node. Then my shoulder (front) started aching, then it went to arm. A knot appeared in the elbow (inside), then tingling to fingers, with occasional tightness in chest, ache in collarbone and back of shoulder even up back of neck. I had EKG and it was fine, blood work (CBC) it was fine, mamo was fine, ultrasound of elbow didn t even show the knot, ultrasound of heart and aorta was fine, MRI of shoulder showed some tendenosis, but that s all. A nerve test of arm was fine. Symptoms started diminishing. My breast still gets sore some and raising my arm high will pull at it. Then a year and half ago I had ACL reconstruction. A week ago, I had to have orthoscopic surgery to take out scar tissue and fix it. I could not get it straight and it was getting worse. I was walking with a limp. About 3 months before that I started headaches almost daily and almost always on the left side. Then I started having a pain in my left jaw. I could not open it wide enough to even bite a cupcake. That lasted a week, then I got what seemed like a cold. I coughed up phlem and some mixed in blood. It went on for 14 days, by the end it was mostly clear and some bit foamy. I took Amoxacillin for 10 days. Cough went away, but jaw still hurt. I took it for 7 more days. No change and now my arm (left) was hurting again. My blood pressure was 126/?70. It is usually 112-116. I had struggles at work and it was a week before my 2nd ACL surgery. My dr. thought it may be stress. She said she felt no swollen nodes. They told me to take Cymbolta. I took it for 2 days. We had to go to Fl. for a funeral, I forgot to take it on day 3. My arm seemed fine and no change in my jaw so I quit. 4 days later was that 2nd surgery. I had IV fluids and antibiotic. 4 days later, my jaw still sore and a sore on my gum, my tonge thick and white, my throat very red, white patches on my inside jaw and then a day later teeth achy. Dr. said sorta looked like thrush, but not as fussy. Ordered oral nystatin 4 times a day. Dentist said thought it was thrush. Dentist took panoramic x-ray. No absess, no lessions, jaw joints look good. Said probably stress. I had had some episodes of lightheadedness too - especially when looking down. Then some pressure in back of neck. Woke up with throat tightness one day. Went to ENT 2 days later after dentist. Hearing test ok, eardrums ok. He felt my throat, felt my jaw, looked in my mouth and said yes thrush, dry tongue, and probably stress - said to call dentist and get mouth guard for night. He said the muscle runs down throat and can cause a tightness. I have also had a tender spot on an off on the forehead left side and the right temple area. I was doing great today 1 day later and feeling good until as I was cooking dinner, my left arm started aching again and then a pressure in my back of my neck then head feeling heavy and large then tightness in my throat. I could breathe fine, but it felt tight. About half hour the tightness subsided, but arm still ached and in front of shoulder hurt. That lasted for about another hour. Then ache went away I felt good for about 10 minutes and the tightness in throat started back with some pressure on and off in sinus to nose. Mostly left side. Still breathing ok. A few burps which were hard to get out. Like something wouldn t let the air out easy. I can swallow, but it feels like a blob in there. I am so concerned. I have 2 little kids and I worry something really serious is being missed that needs taken care of now. Please help. I don t know where to turn or what to do. So worried.",
  "A": "Madam, I think you are aged enough to enter the menopausal stage and your concern for breast lump with pain is understandable too. Now that MRI and repeat examination of breast with pain as presenter have said no cause for worry. But your restful pain in oral cavity, Cough etc. are pointers to more proneness to infections which are getting resolved with attention received but are heavily depressing for you to bear along with some elevations in your B. P readings impel me to advise you better undergo Diabetic profile to rule out its onset already in view of subtle symptoms Pershing with you for years."
