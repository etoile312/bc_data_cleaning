  "A": "Hi.it is best if you consult with a doctor, preferably a general surgeon, in regard to your concern. Clinical evaluation is best. Breast ultrasound may be requested for imaging and knowing the lesions present in your breasts, as well as the size and characteristics. Not all lesions should be excised but if there are indications, especially if imaging would suggest tissue correlation, one may do so. Regular self breast examination and monitoring (through clinical breast examination and imaging) must be done. Management will be directed accordingly. Hope this helps. Good day!!~ Chat Doctor. "
