  "Q": "I am scared to death.. My father (family history of ovarian , breast cancer accompanied by all brothers dying of hearth problems of one sort or the other and sisters having ovarian/breast cancer to handle)... Lived to the ripe old age of 63 b/c he forgot to tell us he needed treatment to live. Next, my mom (Schmitz paranoid) forgot to tell my brother and I of her family history... She died 23 days post diag of stag 4 mast liver cancer .., found out 3 of her siblings had died of mast cancer of either stomach, liver or kidney .... Where do I stand.... I am now 45, but had thyroid removed at 27 due to abnormal (Non malignant) growths.... I have since been diagnosed with chronic AND acute (you figure) RA?. I do not question the diagnosis, but their means of treatment... I do not want injections and monthly cancer treatments if avoidable. I also do not want to resume a regimens of pain meds to treat. That is nothing other than torture in and of itself... Unless you have a countdown, no one should ever cross that threshold.",
  "A": "Hi! Welcome to Chat Doctor! I would like to tell you that cancer is such a common disease that it is no surprise that many families have at least a few members who have had cancer. Sometimes, certain types of cancer seem to run in some families, but only a small portion of all cancers are inherited. You had thyroid growth which was not malignant so nothing to worry. Now for acute and chronic RA, Its true that there is no cure for RA, but treatments can improve symptoms and slow the progress of the disease. Disease-modifying treatment has the best results when it is started early and aggressively. Regular exercise is recommended as both safe and useful to maintain muscles strength and overall physical function. I sincerely hope this will help you!TAKE CARE!"
