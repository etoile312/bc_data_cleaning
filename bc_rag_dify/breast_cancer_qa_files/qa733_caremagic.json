  "Q": "My mom developed lichen planus right before she started chemo for breast cancer. She has now completed 6 rounds of chemo and still has a ways to go. Her lichen planus seems to be getting worse. You would think that the chemo is causing this but she started to get it before chemo even started. Is there anything she can do to help her clear this up or at least manage it so it doesn t get any worse? She still as 4 more months of chemo treatments.",
  "A": "Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. Your mother has lichen plans and breast cancer. Breast cancer chemotherapy definitely affect the lichen plans adversely. But don't worry much about that. Complete cancer treatment first. Lichen plans can be treated by topical retinoids or topical steroids or light therapy. Consult your doctor and plan accordingly. Hope I have answered your question. If you have any doubts then feel free to ask me. I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health."
