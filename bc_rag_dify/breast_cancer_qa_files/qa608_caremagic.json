  "Q": "I am currently going through chemo for breast cancer, the chemo drug I am taking is taxol... I now have some discomfort in my lower left side... And it hurts when I cough... I am a little constipated from the chemo and steroids they gave last Monday... Is the pain caused by the constipation?",
  "A": "Hi, Thanks for writing in. Cough is a protective reflex that helps in expulsion of secretions from the airway. Coughing also involves the contraction of the abdominal muscles. Sometimes during severe cough the patient might develop continuous muscle contractions in the lower abdominal wall and this causes pain and discomfort/The pain is not because of the chemotherapy. People who are treated for cancer usually end up with a low immunity. This makes it possible for mild respiratory infections to affect the person. Due to the increased cough, there might be fatigue in the lower abdominal wall muscle. Please take a cough suppressant after discussing with your doctor. Please do not worry."
