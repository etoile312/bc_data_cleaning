  "A": "Hi, If you'd like to send a JPG file of your MRI that demonstrates the colloid cyst I'd be happy to verify its presence.  However, if that's what the problem is then, the only definitive surgery to relieve your symptoms is surgical. Otherwise, the result could be an acute case of HY Chat Doctor.  It also depends on how the cyst was initially removed...if by aspiration then, recurrence rates are high usually requiring repeat procedures.  Definitive results can be obtained by radical excision or stereotactically guided microsurgical techniques nowadays has resulted in a much higher success rate than ever before.  Check in with academic teaching hospitals in your area.  The neurosurgical dept. likely has dedicated surgeons to this sort of procedure using the latest approaches.  Consultation with a different neurosurgical service may also provide you with more answers to the dilemma which I understand is on your mind regarding the risks of another surgery.  This time be sure to ask about the exact procedure they intend on using. Aspiration is the least likely to give long term results. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. "
