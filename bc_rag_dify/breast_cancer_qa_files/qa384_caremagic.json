  "Q": "Is it still possible to be pregnant even if you \"think\" you have your period?  Im 25 and My breast are really sore and seem like they are bigger but my breats have NEVER been sore throuhgout my cycle in my life.  I got my expected period on wednesday nov 8th and its light.  When can I take an accurate home pregnancy test?",
  "A": "Hello, and I hope I can help you today. A pregnancy test will be accurate at this point if your period came on time, but many things can affect the amount of breast tenderness you have during your menses, like weight changes, salt intake, and irregular hormones for other reasons (like a missed ovulation) which can also give you a light period. So you may accurately do a pregnancy test if you are at risk for conception. However, the greatest likelihood is that you are not pregnant. I hope I was able to answer your question today and that this information was helpful. Best wishes, "
