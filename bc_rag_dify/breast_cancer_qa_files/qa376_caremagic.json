  "Q": "i dont know if im pregnant or not but ibeen having these back pains on m lower back then i missed my period like a week ago. i took 2 test and they botChatDoctore out negative. & the cramps they havent stopped my left tittie feels very tender and sometimes its really painful. am i pregnant ? i havent vomit yet .",
  "A": "Dear friend if two test regarding pregnancy gives negative result then as a rational clinician I would say first you have to check whether you have urinary tract infection. Because urinary tract infection almost always cause low abdomen pain.to confirm you have to undergo a routine urine microscopic check-up. Tenderness in your breast has no relation with your urinary tract infection. Perhaps Brest engorgement due to hormonal disbalance is behind this condition. So don't worry too much on these.a general clinical check-up is what you need to get a fair idea about the cause of such breast tenderness and low abdominal pain."
