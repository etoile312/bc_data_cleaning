  "Q": "Hi, I had the copper coil fitted as an emergency contraception on the 5th day of the condom coming off during intercourse - (I was at my most fertile period mid month) I also took the morning after pill 19 hours after intercourse. 6 days after I took the MAP and 3 days after I had the copper coil fitted l bled a reasonably heavy period for 9 days. It s 5 weeks and 4 days since I last had intercourse and my period is 5 days late. I am spotting brown blood but minimal - only when I wipe after a pee. I have taken 2 pregnancy tests and both have been a strong negative. Is this normal of the copper coil or could I be pregnant? On research, the copper coil is supposed to increase blood and not the opposite during menstruation. I am experiencing painful breasts but no other symptoms. I am anxious as I desperately don t want to be pregnant. I hope you can advise me. Thank you.",
  "A": "Hi, I have gone through your query and understood the concern. The cause of the delayed period and the breast tenderness is the high hormone content in the emergency contraceptive pill that you have consumed. This is also the cause of the with Chat Doctor.  Home pregnancy tests read well when performed 3-7 days after a missed period with a fresh early morning sample of urine. If you wish to exclude earlier, please get the estimation of the serum beta-ChatDoctor titles. Further, a trans-vaginal sonogram done a week or two after the missed period gives the status of the pelvic organs and excludes/confirms pregnancy. Do not worry, you have very little chance of conception. Remember that stress also can delay a period. Hope this helps."
