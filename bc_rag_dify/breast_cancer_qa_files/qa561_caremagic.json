  "Q": "Im 18 years of age. I feel a throbbing lump under my arm, which I believe came from the usage of Secret deodorant because my mother used to have the problem. But I havent used that deodorant in years, and I dont use deodorant as much anymore. But I get this occasional lump under my arm, but now I believe I feel a lump in my breast. What do you recommend?",
  "A": "Hi.I suggest you use a hypoallergenic deodorant or the ones with low aluminum content. It seems that your underarm is very sensitive to those chemicals. It might be a case of beginning hi Chat Doctor.  A medical consult for physical examination and management is recommended.in regard to your breast lump, I suggest you consult with a general/breast surgeon and ask for a breast ultrasound to further evaluate your breast lump. This might just be a simple cyst, but a thorough examination and evaluation should be done first. Hope this helps. Good day!!~"
