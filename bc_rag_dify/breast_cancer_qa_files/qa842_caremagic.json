  "Q": "I have had implanon birth control for a year now but the cramping pain is so bad lately an I usually get my period even after having the implanon for a while like normal until this month I only spotted for half a day now all I do is sit in pain and nausea and vomiting how likely can it be pregnancy",
  "A": "Hello misunderstand your concernImplanon is 99 percent effective, so chance of pregnancy is one percent. You should go for pregnancy test if period is missed by 10 days that confirm the pregnancy. Spotting and abdominal cramp may be side effects of implant. Following are the side effects of it: spotting, irregular periods, amenorrhea pain and cramps in abdomen and breast tenderness. If period will not come, consult the gynecologist and go for ultrasound and hormone testing that rule out cause like pelvic inflammatory disease and uterine pathology. Hope this may help you Best regards"
