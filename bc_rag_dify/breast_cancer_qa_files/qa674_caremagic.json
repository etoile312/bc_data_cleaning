  "A": "Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. She has breast cancer and taking chemotherapy.  Cause is common with tablet Serra. You can take ondansetron to avoid nausea and vomiting.  You should not stop the tablet without your doctors' advice. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health."
