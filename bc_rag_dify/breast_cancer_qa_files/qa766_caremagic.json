  "Q": "I am a 54 year old breast cancer survivor. Found a 2.8 cm cyst on right ovary. Have had lower back pain like sciatica that goes through hip and down leg. Can this pain be elated to cyst or do I have 2 problems. Can relieve pain in a hot tub or heating pad.",
  "A": "Hello, The pain is unlikely to be related to cyst as it is a lower back pain and not groin pain or lower abdomen. Before labelling it to the cyst, it will be wise to get an X-Ray lumbosacral spine (Better would be an MRI of lumbosacral spine) and see if there is any compression of nerves. You may take a painkiller with a muscle relaxant like rapine DSR when you need it. Avoid bending and pulling or pushing heavyweight till you get the tests. Also, get Sr. It. D and Calcium levels and treat them if found low. Wish you good health."
