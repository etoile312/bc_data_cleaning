  "A": "Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. You have history of breast cancer.  So there is high chance that you have metastatic breast cancer in lymph node.  You should go for fine needle aspiration cytology or biopsy of lymph node to confirm.  Then you should take treatment accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health."
