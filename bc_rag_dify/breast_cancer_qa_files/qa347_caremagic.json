  "Q": "i am 49 year old woman , saw my doc because of breast pain and i had a lump under my left nipple,that said i had a mamograhm and ultra sound , they want to repete in 6 months saying they saw enlarged breast ducts and calsifications but not explaining  , i keep finding small lumps all over my chest a little smaller than a dime . I still have sharp breast pain that wakes me up at night and the small lumps hurt like a bruse . what do you think i should do ?",
  "A": "Welcome to Chat Doctor .1. Initially when you have examined and imaged for breast lesions - they have asked you followup 6months.2. That means they did find a lesion which is not towards malignancy / cancer but still suspicion was there.3. Now you are symptomatic with pain and discomfort, I would suggest getting followup scan as soon as possible.4. With your age and above-mentioned symptoms do not delay, get in to action as soon as possible.5. A repeat mammogram and an ultrasound scan would help. Hope it helps you. Wish you a good health. Anything to ask ? Do not hesitate. Thank you."
