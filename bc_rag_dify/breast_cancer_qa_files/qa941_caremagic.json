  "A": "Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. Cancer is not contagious disease.  However, it runs in family because of hereditary factors.  So if your other sisters had cancer then you have high chance of cancer because of genetic cause.  Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health."
