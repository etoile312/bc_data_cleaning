  "Q": "hi i m unmarried 26 year old girl having breast lump from last 8 years.i have nothing sign and symptom except slight pain (that is on touch and some time without touch not related to cycle pain is sharp and fluctuating type)and light inflammation,i m out of my country so i didnt concern to doctor for this because i cant take Rx from here.what do u think it is benign or malignant disease? may i know any medical treatment for this because i dont like surgery here.please guide me.thank you",
  "A": "Hello there, With your history it is highly likely that the lump is benign. It can be a lipoma or a fibroadenoma both of which are benign conditions. Once you get back to your country a mammogram should be done to see the extent of the lump. If you do not have a genetic history i.e. your mother, grandmothers, aunts have not been affected by any breast related illnesses you can let it remain as it is, and no surgery is required except vigilance on any change in size of the lump. Evening primrose oil may help in reducing pain and other symptoms of the breast lump related to your cycles. Please get back to me with any further queries, I will be glad to answer them."
