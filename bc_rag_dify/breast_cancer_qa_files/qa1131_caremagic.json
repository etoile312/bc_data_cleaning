  "Q": "I am having extreme pelvic pain, lower back pain and pressure. I had a pelvic ultrasound done. It showed fibroid tumors. I was told those shouldn t cause my pain. I don t know whether to go see a different gynecologist, have a colonoscopy (I m 54 and never had one) or what. Had an ecoli infection recently, very concentrated urine with bacteria. Now since then I also have urinary frequency which I never had before. I had a TOT a few years ago.",
  "A": "Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. You have uterine fibroid.  Your pain may be due to urinary tract infection or fibroid.  You should take a course of antibiotics to clear the infection.  If your pain remain persistent then you should go for surgery to remove fibroid.  Hysterectomy or mastectomy are the options depending on your reproductive wish. Consult your doctor and take treatment accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health."
