  "Q": "Iv been checking my breast for lumps and found loads of little ones and one thats quite big but every time i find it it moves again, theres also places that feel like hard tissue, i have the implanon birth control and my cycles have always been irregular even more so now and im wondering if it could be an effect from the birth control of something more serious?",
  "A": "Hello, Birth control through hormones can create breast masses as a side effect and this is why regular evaluation by a specialist is necessary during treatment. Please see a specialist immediately to get the masses assessed through clinical exam and further investigations like mammogram. The implant may have to be removed. Please opt for non-hormonal methods of contraception in future or until your consultant pronounces you free to use hormones again. Hope you find this information helpful. Wish you good health."
