  "Q": "my mother is a breast cancer patient she took all the chemo and radiation tests a year back.then doctor gave her tamoxifen to use for 5 years. now she is having severe cough which is not stopping at all for 3-4 months. we went to physician got lung x-ray done it is normal, blood test done,BP is normal she has 9.8gms%haemoglobin.she took anti biotics but cough is severe she cannot sleep properly.is it related to heart problems please give me suggestion.",
  "A": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. In my opinion you should get done ECG and 2D Echo to rule out cardiac causes. Many times early cardiac failure gives cough at night only. Due to this patient is not able to sleep. So better to consult cardiologist and get done ECG and 2D Echo. Another possibility is low hemoglobin (9.8). Low He can also cause Chat Doctor.  So start iron supplements. If cardiac work up is normal than get done PFT (Pulmonary Function Test) to rule out radiation induced bronchitis."
