  "Q": "my daughter inlaw was diganosed with stage 4 breast cancer over a year ago she had chemo for five months and everythinng  went well and then she had a seizer and found to have brain mets~she had 20 full head radiation treatments~she is doing ok but its been about six mo since radiation~she dont eat good and is very thin~will this all go away and can we count on a full recovery~could she be cured?",
  "A": "Hi, Metastatic breast cancer is not curable. Brain metastasis itself has very bad prognosis. Radiation is the only treatment (surgery has also role in limited cases). Now you have not mentioned the hormone receptor status. Probably she is on antiestrogen. Anyway, the treatment at this stage is complex. And brain metastasis can cause nausea, vomiting headache. Anorexia is due the disease itself. You have to try your best to feed her. No specific medication will be much helpful to increase the appetite. As long as she can maintain nutrition, she can fight the disease."
