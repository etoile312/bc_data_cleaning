  "Q": "I am a breast cancer survivor and now I found this lump on my arm on the other side of the elbow. I does not hurt yet it has been there for over a month now. Just wondering what it could be and if I should be concerned about it all. Thank you for taking the time to read this.",
  "A": "Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. You have history of cancer. So you may have chances of recurrence or some metastatic tumor. Or it might be some simple lesion like lipoma or cyst. You should go for biopsy of that lump. It will give you clear idea about cause. Then you should take treatment accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have any doubts then contact me at bit.ly/ Chat Doctor. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health."
