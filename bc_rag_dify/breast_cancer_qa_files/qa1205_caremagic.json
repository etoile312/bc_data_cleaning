  "Q": "I am concerned have implants sacs now saline was removed I had them in for 11 years before one popped. I am having pain and greenish brown discharge from the nipple bilaterally especially the one that was aspirated . One breast is 1 1/2 times larger than the other with in the last 36 hours . I dont feel any lumps but the implant itself. Could leaving the implant sacs there cause any serious disease (cancer).",
  "A": "Leaving the implant sacs do not cause cancer by themselves but prevent early detection of cancer if it develops. I would have liked to know your age, the number of child Chat Doctor.  Either way, any nipple discharge needs to be investigated, although the history that you give is more in favor of an infection rather than cancer. To be certain, I would advise you to get a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of both breast, along with cytology testing of the discharge (the lab guy will take your discharge on a glass slide and examine it under a microscope). If both these tests are normal, then you have nothing to worry about. Meanwhile, start taking Tab. Ciprofloxacin 500 mg twice daily + Tab. Paracetamol 650 mg thrice daily + Tab Sanitizing 150 mg Twice daily for 7 days."
