  "Q": "Hi, may I answer your health queries right now ?  Please type your query here...Hi, Im a 20 year old male and I have noticed that lumps are developing under both of my nipples. I understand that this is normal when going through puberty. This is the second time this is happening (once when I was going through puberty) the lumps went away for approximately 5 or 6 years and now over the past few days I have felt new ones developing. Can you explain this?",
  "A": "Hello, If the lump occurs at approximately a week before or during your menses, it is normal due to breast or hormonal changes during menstruation. But if it doesn't disappear, and you have a family history of breast problems, it is best for you to have at least a breast ultrasound done and a consultation with your physician. You might have fibrotic (benign) lesions in your breast which just needs to be monitored accordingly. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.  "
