  "A": "Hi, dear. I have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. You may have some benign breast lesion like fibroadenoma or fibrotic disease, or you may have malignant lesion like ductal carcinoma.  You should go for fine needle aspiration cytology of your breast lump.  Then take treatment accordingly.  Lumpectomy is advisable for benign lesion and radical mastectomy for malignant lesion.  Consult your doctor and plan accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health."
