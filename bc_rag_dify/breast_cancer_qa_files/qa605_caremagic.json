  "Q": "I am 8 years clear of having had breast cancer. After that I started with Enbrel to help clear my psoriasis to which it did but then after about 4 years it stopped working. The doctor put me on Humira which totally cleared up my psoriasis. But then last year I was diagnosed with mac lung disease and they immediately took me off the Humira. Now I am totally covered with psoriasis, extreme itching & bleeding and horrible discomfort. The doctor won t put me back on Humira but he wants me to go on Stelara. Aren t they one of the same drugs and in your opinion would it be safe for me to try the Stelara?",
  "A": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. Stellar is ustekinumab. Humor is golimumab. Both are monoclonal antibodies useful in psoriasis. Humor is causing more immunosuppression than Stellar. And hence doctors are not giving you Humor because of fear of worsening MAC (Mycobacterium Album Complex) infection. So in my opinion, you should follow your doctor s advice about stellar. Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health. Thanks."
