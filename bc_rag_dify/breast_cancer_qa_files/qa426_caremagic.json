  "Q": "Hello.  I am a 22 year old male.  About 9 months ago, maybe more, I noticed in the shower that my left nipple was sticking out farther than my right.  I promptly squeezed it and it had a discharge much like a pimple before it was empty.  After this, nothing else came out that day, but the nipple has remained larger on the left side, and occasionally (once every few days,) if I squeeze it, it will discharge a tiny bit more.  I cannot identify any lumps of any kind to indicate gynecomastia or breast cancer, and am really stumped/concerned as to what else could possibly be causing unilateral nipple discharge in a 22 year old male.",
  "A": "Dear, We understand your concerns went through your details. A woman can normally have some type of nipple discharge throughout her adult life. For men, nipple discharge can indicate a problem. During hormone imbalances such as adolescence, the male gland can be stimulated. This hormonal stimulation can result in gland growth (Gynecomastia), tenderness, and produce milk and or nipple discharge. If squeezed / traumatized enough, a clear fluid can be express from almost anyone. This is normal but hurting tissues this much is not a good idea. With gland stimulation, the discharge can be milk like or thick like a pimple. Nipple discharge is a concern if:bloody or fluid colored red, pink, or brown looks like pus especially accompanied by inflammation and or fever one sided (unilateral)happens without squeezing the gland sticky and clear or a cloudy black or brown. I suggest you not to try diagnosing your problem. Please consult a surgeon. If you require more of my help in this aspect, please use this URL. http://goo.gl/aYW2pR.
