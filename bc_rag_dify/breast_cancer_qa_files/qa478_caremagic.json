  "A": "Hello. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Firstly what's need to be considered is your present symptoms due to chronic appendicitis. If the symptoms are appearing from time to time and causing severe abdominal pain, then surgery is the option to go for. However, if that is not the case, considering that you already have a handful of other previous medical and surgical history, which has to be taken into account, surgery would not be the most ideal option and the symptoms due to chronic appendicitis can be managed with medications. Your doctor would be the best person for the advice considering that the doctor can take into consideration the results from the 3rd CT scan. Feel free to ask for further queries. Regards."
