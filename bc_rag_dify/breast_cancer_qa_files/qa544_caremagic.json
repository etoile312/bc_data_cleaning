  "A": "Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. You may have some benign tumor of soft tissue or metastatic cancer. You should go for fine needle aspiration cytology or biopsy of that lump. It will give you exact diagnosis. Then you should take treatment accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have any doubts then contact me at bit.ly/ Chat Doctor. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health."
