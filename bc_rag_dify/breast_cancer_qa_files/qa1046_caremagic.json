  "Q": "Hello, I am currently being treated for breast cancer. A medi port was inserted, about 9 weeks ago, for easy access. A few days ago I was coughing a lot, I also had developed neuropathy of hands and feet....I noticed my neck started to hurt, as if perhaps I had pulled my port loose from my artery after all of the coughing. I asked my Oncologist to look; She ordered an ultrasound from Cardiology. It confirmed that I had developed deep vein and superficial clots in my neck. I am on my 3rd self injection of blood thinner(2x per day). The pain has spread into a wider area and is more intense. Should I be concerned(?) What symptoms should prompt a closer look from a Dr.(?) What should I expect as a Prognosis????",
  "A": "Hi, Thanks for writing in. There seems to be deep vein thrombosis involving veins in the neck. This needs to be treated on time to prevent further problems. Blood thinners are essential to dissolve the clots and prevent new clots from happening. Please go to ER should you have breathlessness or chest pain from within. The clots already present must be treated and not allowed to progress further and reach the lungs. If they reach lungs then complete blood supply to the lungs will be cut off and this can cause respiratory distress and failure. In severe cases it can also be life-threatening. It is good that your doctor has given you blood thinners. However, any time you feel difficulty to breathe and cardiac chest pain then do not hesitate to go to the ER and talk to your doctor. Please do not worry."
