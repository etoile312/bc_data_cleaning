  "Q": "Noticed slight nipple discharge and it could have happened 1 mos ago. Last 3d mamo normal nov 2012In 2011 normal mamo done which was followed by MRI which was fine. I am a little paranoid due to my dense breast tissue. I have never had a cancer diagnosis and no breast cancer in my family. I have an appt next week but i want to know if I should be this concerned",
  "A": "Dear Ma'am, Sorry to hear about your problem. Dense breasts can pose problems in early detection of breast cancer, but it can be overcome by regular breast cancer screening, which you are undergoing. Nipple discharge can be normal or scary depending on the color, amount and whether it is associated with a breast lump or not. What is the nature of your nipple discharge? You should visit your doctor and get a regular screening done. Hoping for the best. Please feel free to clarify any other query."
