  "Q": "My daughter has fibroadenoma.  She had a mammogram and the doctor says that one of the lumps has developed \"roots\" that are wrapping around the milk ducts and blood vessels.  Do you have an image that I could see to get an idea of what it looks like?  Also, how extensive will this surgery be?  She had a biopsy.  What are the odds that it can be cancerous?",
  "A": "Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern.  It may be fibroadenoma. Fibroadenoma is the benign lump in breast.  It is firm to hard and movable mass and mostly painless. You should go for biopsy or fine needle aspiration cytology of that lump.  It will give you exact diagnosis.  If is fibroadenoma then there is no need to worry.  It needs lumpectomy which is a minor surgery. Consult your doctor and take treatment accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health."
