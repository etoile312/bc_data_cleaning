  "Q": "There is one lump now causing pain at the front of my shoulder . . . It developed some time now under where my bra strap rests. All my life I have had very large breasts, so I ve had to pull my straps very tightly for support. Ultrasound results were relayed to me as nothing to worry about yet, my doctor is suggesting an MRI because there is some damage . . . How should I interpret things thus far in this regard? I am confused by the word damage and what that might suggest, yet suspicious that there might be something serious because of the need for the MRI!?",
  "A": "Hi, Dear,Thanks for your query to Chat Doctor. Dear I read your query and reviewed it with context to your query facts. Based on the facts of your query, you seem to suffer from-Bra Strap Abrasion with Normal USG of the Breast. MRI for the damage ? In this scenario, I would suggest you to undergo Mammogram and repeat USG for Second Opinion from another Radiologist. This would reduce your anxiety and worry caused by this ambiguity of reports from the earlier doctors. MRI if suggested ? Cant be opined blindly unless physical examination from Surgeon and second opinion on the USG from another Radiologist is taken. Hope this would help you to plan further treatment with your family and specialist doctors there. Welcome for any further query in this regard. Good Day!! Chat Doctor. N. Senior Surgical Specialist.
