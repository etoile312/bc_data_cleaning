  "A": "Hello SWAT;welcome to Chat Doctor Pain in lower abdomen; breast pain may be the symptoms at time of pregnancy but the first symptom to look for pregnancy is when you missed your period. So see if you have crossed your due date of periods;if yes then get a pregnancy test done with first morning sample of urine. Till you miss your period there is no symptom to suspect pregnancy so once you miss the date you can test yourself. Thanks"
