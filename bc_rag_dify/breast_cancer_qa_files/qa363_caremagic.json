  "A": "Hi, Yamini is an oral contraceptive pill and will help only if you have irregular periods. This can have several side effects like Nausea, vomiting, bleeding between menstrual periods, weight gain, breast tenderness and thrombophlebitis, stroke, heart attack and angina sectors, headache. Conceiving would not be possible when your wife is taking this tablet. If there is a problem conceiving, please see a gynecologist. A detailed history and examination is needed. Hope this helps Regards"
