  "Q": "I have a 9 mm invasive ductal carcinoma which is less than 1 cm.  Last week an ultra sound found 5 tiny lesions cry close to the original tumor.   They assume the lesions are cancer and told me after surgery they will test it and add the sizes together so then my tumor size could be a 3 cm which would change my stage to 2.   No evidence at this time that there is cancer in nodes so my question is will my treatment plan change and in what ways?  Obviously they will take the tumor and 5 lesions out during surgery but what about chemotherapy and hormone drug treatment?  Thanks",
  "A": "Hi and thank you so much for this query. I am so sorry to hear about this breast cancer. There would be no change in the treatment plan as stage 1 and stage 2 are treated in the same way. This consist in surgery and radiation therapy. Further treatment like hormonal therapy and chemotherapy would depend on the laboratory findings of the nodes and the receptors on the surface of this mass. It is never an easy task dealing with breast cancer. I encourage you to stand strong, face the challenges and sure you would be able to fight your way out of this. I hope this ad Chat Doctor.
