  "Q": "Hi,Ive been breastfeeding my baby since she was a new born she had some weight loss in the beginning and she would cry every time I would  put her on my left breast so I told the pediatrician and he told me lets give her formula and breast milk. I noticed only 2drops of milk would come out of my left breast so I told my prescription theirs something wrong with my left breast Im only breast feeding with one breast my right side and I told her breast cancer runs in my family she said dont stop breastfeeding it heals breast cancer  does it?Well I havent stop breastfeeding then all of a sudden last week buttermilk started coming out. What should I do?",
  "A": "HIT hank for asking to ChatDoctorMam ! Breastfeeding is God given gift to a mother as well as to a baby, no formula being made like milk of mother, the information given to you is wrong, you just keep feeding the child even with breast which is lack in milk the sucking action of baby may induce the lactation or else try Domeperidone tab, one tab. Thrice in day. Feel proud while feeding feel happy when baby start crying for feed have nice day."
