  "Q": "Hi, my name is rose and Im very scared of what Im feeling right now.. Cause, this morning I squeeze my left nipple and it hurt. Only the nipple notnthe breast. Can u please tell me if its normal or abnormal .. Or I have breast cancer???? Im 21 years old and Im 5 feet..and i weight 145 .",
  "A": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor.First, no need to worry at all for breast cancer. So stop thinking about breast cancer as your age is too young for cancer. And pain is not a feature of breast cancer. Squeezing of nipple if forcefully done can itself cause pain without any disease. Other causes for nipple pain are infection, irritation, hormonal changes etc. So no need to worry at all for cancer. You are not having cancer for sure. So be relaxed and calm."
