  "Q": "I have Dermatomyositis and through a CT scan they found two cysts on my remaining right ovary. My sister died of breast cancer so I really think I should have the ovary removed to prevent any further involvement. I am 51 years old and have not had a period since I was 35 years old. I have read that ovarian cancer can be an underlying involvement associated with Dermatomyositis. Please help me!!",
  "A": "Hi and welcome to Chat Doctor, thanks for the query. There are no recommendations which suggest something like this and I don't see a reason for it too. You should just have frequent follow up of your ovaries and you don't have to hurry to have surgery. Deramtomiozitis isn't related to ovarian cancer and cysts can be evacuated by specialist so that malignancy is ruled out. Wish you good health. Regards"
