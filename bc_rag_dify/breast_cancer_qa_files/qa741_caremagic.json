  "Q": "hi my name is Jocelyne and recently I went to the doctors and they told me I had one ovary smaller then the other and they also said that my menstrual cycle would be irregular. my question is whether or not birth control would help make my menstrual cycle come every month or would it just damage my reproductive system even more?",
  "A": "Hello Jocelyn, Thank you for the question. It is quite unclear as to what your doctors told you about your ovaries. Is your menstrual cycle irregular? Have they told you that you have POlycystic ovaries? If yes then birth control pills are in fact the right choice of medicines to get your period regularly. Birth control pills are low doses of hormones which will allow your periods to come every month at a regular interval (during the pill free period). There is no evidence that these pills damage the reproductive system. There maybe some side effects with these medicines like headaches, nausea vomiting, breast tenderness, but these are mild and fade away in few days to weeks.However, these pills are not going to cure your underlying problem. So do discuss with your treating doctor about the cause for your irregular periods and ovary being small. I am sure your doctor will explain after seeing the reports if any. Hope this helps. Take care."
