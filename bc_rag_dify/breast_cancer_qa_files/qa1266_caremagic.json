  "A": "Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. She has history of breast cancer with metastasis in to brain and other part. So it is stage 4 cancer.  Surgery is nit possible in that cases.  Chemotherapy, radiotherapy and hormonal therapy is the treatment of choice.  Consult your doctor and take treatment accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health."
