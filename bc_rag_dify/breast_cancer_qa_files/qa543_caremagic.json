  "Q": "I have been having pain under my left breast. I have breast implants and have gained about 30 lbs since the surgery. It is not a constant pain however it hurts to wear a bra, especially one with wire. could this be a muscle issue or something bigger like gall bladder or heart issue?",
  "A": "Here you need to check couple of things.1. Do you have pain while walking or doing some activity immediately after that.?., also do you have breathing difficulty along with that? If yes then it could be related to your heart.2. Do you have regular acidity problem, and indigestion issues regularly? If yes then it could be related to gall balladeer stone. But still the conformation will be done by your ultrasound of abdomen. Which will also reveal if there is anything else.3. If both above tests or observation are normal then need to consult the surgeon who has kept the implant for you and check it out properly. What ever the case at home you can also use a hot and cold pack to get some relief for muscular pain. Take care"
