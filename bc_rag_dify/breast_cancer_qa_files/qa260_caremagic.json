  "A": "Hello Madam, Thank you for your question and welcome to Chat Doctor. I read carefully your query and I understand your concerns. 1. Normal levels of Serum Lunatic Oxaloacetate Transaminase (GOT) may slightly vary depending on the individual laboratories reference values. In the laboratory I work a value of 36.80 is considered normal, since the range which we consider normal is from 5 to 40 units per liter of serum.2. Even though your liver transaminase (STOP and SGPT)are normal in my opinion, I would recommend you a nutrient-rich, plant-based diet, foods rich in antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals, in addition to being low in fat. Green leafy vegetables, broccoli, carrots, squash and a variety of fresh fruits should be staples of your diet, along with nuts, whole grains, low-fat dairy products and lean meats.3. Fast Blood Sugar value is high. Normally, a value more than 7.0 MML/l or higher on two separate tests indicates that you have diabetes. I would recommend you seek a consult with your local endocrinologist. 4. As I understand, the thing you are most concerned of, is if your test results show that your liver is affected from cancer. My impression is that your laboratory results show nothing to worry, and I don't think that your liver is affected. Hope this answers your question. If you have additional questions or follow-up questions then please do not hesitate in writing to us. I will be happy to answer your questions. Wishing you good health,"
