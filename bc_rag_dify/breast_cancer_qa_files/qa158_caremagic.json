  "Q": "I finished chemo for breast cancer (taxotere) 4 weeks ago and have had 5 lots of radiotherapy this week. Yesterday around mid day I started having severe pain in my abdomen,my ribs downwards ie not my stomache. My temperature rose to 38.7 yesterday evening and I started shaking. I took paracetamol and temp went down after 2  hours. Today I still have the pain and my abdomen is bloated. Paracetamol does not take the pain away.",
  "A": "Hi. Radiotherapies for Breast Cancer and the medicines for cancer like Texture itself causes all the symptoms as its complications. This is because to tissue Necrosis and its attendant side effects. Paracetamol alone can not help in such cases. This will settle with time, as the bodies resistance power and Healing power picks up. On a safer side it is better to take an antibiotic as you had raised temperature. There can be a close cavity infection, Take an X-ray of the chest and Ultrasonography of the abdomen to rule out underlying causes. You may take tramadol or Ibuprofen for pain relief if needed"
