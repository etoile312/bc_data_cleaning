  "Q": "Im 60 and found out I had a horseshoe kidney about 10 years ago. I have been living with advanced breast cancer for about 25 years. I take lots if pills and chemotherapy about once or twice a year. What should I know about my kidney to help me to be healthy? Can use hurt the kidney by falling on a hard item, like bruising?",
  "A": "Hello and welcome to Chat Doctor. As a Urologist, i must assure you, theres nothing to worry about. Horseshoe kidney is just a congenital(by birth), variant of normal kidney. Its position is lower than the normal placed kidneys. Hence, instead of the kidneys being in the two flanks at the back, it's located in front lower part or pelvis. This abnormal location on the front side, doesn't affect function of kidney. Falling forwards on a hard object or sharp object has a potential threat of injury to the kidneys, which easily made out on a scan. Hope you're relieved of your doubts. You can get my expert opinion, sending it as a direct question.  Chat Doctor.  Manga."
