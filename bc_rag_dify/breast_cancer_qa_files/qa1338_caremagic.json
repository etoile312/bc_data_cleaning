  "Q": "This is to inquire about a patient who is a diagnosed case of CA-Breast ( triple negative ) , previously on chemotherapy ( Adriamycin , 5-FU , cyclophosphamide ) , who now has hepatic metastasis in both the lobes ( CT scan as done on 18/12/2012 Multiple hypoechoic regions largest being 1.4 cm , free bile duct , portal vein , aorta , IVC ) and right pleural effusion and basal atelectasia. May I know what are the treatment options left along with the prognosis with the treatment and without the treatment ? Oncologist started the patient on nebuliser salbutamol and ipratropium bromide ... but I fail to understand why now ... patient doesnt have any pulmonary symptoms . The patient is my relative and is 54 years old . I am 3rd year medical student . Please respond at your earliest convenience .",
  "A": "Hi, your patient has got pulmonary disease that is atelectasis and pleural effusion. It is to inform you that triple negative breast cancers are highly aggressive. High chance of metastasis. Without examining the patient it is difficult to comment on treatment options. But chemotherapy with higher regimes like taxane may be helpful. Exact life expectancy is difficult to predict, and it will depend on response. Consult your oncologist."
