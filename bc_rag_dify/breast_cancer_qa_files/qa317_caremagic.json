  "Q": "My wife 61 years has received brain radiation therapy (15 sessions) for suspected solitary cancer lesion detected 15 days after left breast surgery for removal of lump.She has disturbed gait despite brain radiation therapy which was completed 5 days ago. Please advise as to when normal gait would be restored. What further treatment may be required.At present she is taking 4 mg. dexan BD.",
  "A": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. Radiation therapy for brain can cause damage to surrounding vital structures and can produce brain edema (inflammatory). This edema also compress surrounding brain structures and can produce defects. So in my opinion your wife is having edema, that is why shriven Dean. Dean is steroid and reduces inflammatory edema. So if she is not improving in 1-2 week better to get done repeat CT or MRI to see for edema. If worsening edema than craniectomy is required to release the pressure."
