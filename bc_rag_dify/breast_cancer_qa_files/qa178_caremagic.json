  "Q": "i have question on my look of my chest ,i am doing my gym regularly with my all cardio workouts also.i need to get my chest flat,square and good look.it looks like some fat muscles accumulate under my chest and its not going away.so it gives puffy appearance which i dont like.i checked in internet that for this problem we can take gynexin,gynemax,should i need to consult any doctor before taking this pill.whether this pill directly acts only on chest muscles?or is that purely herbal without side effects?",
  "A": "Hi, Based on the history you seem to have developed gynecomastia or fatty breast tissue. You should consult your doctor for proper clinical examination and to determine any underlying cause. Although a number of medications like clonidine, tamoxifen and anastrazole are claimed to be effective however FDA has not approved them for this condition. If enlarged breasts are bothersome your doctor may advise liposuction or mastectomy. Genetic is a herbal formula claimed to be effective in reducing the fat tissue in the chest however its efficacy and safety has not been proved on any clinical trials. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Take care "
