  "A": "Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. Your age and sex is very important in this case.  Please tell me your age and sex.  If you are male then it can be due to gynecomastia. If you are female then some other cause like fibroadenoma or fibrotic disease may be there.  So please give me information so that I can help you further. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health."
