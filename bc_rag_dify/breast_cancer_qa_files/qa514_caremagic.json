  "Q": "I have tiny red dots on both of my legs from knee to ankle. They each one have a white circle around them. There is no itching, burning or pain. What could cause this? I have had breast cancer . Now, they are looking for uterine cancer . Could this possibly be connected? The only medication change I have had is a Percocet at Dr; s request for pain prior to biopsy of uterus. I only took one, which was a week ago. Any helpful information?",
  "A": "Hello and thank you for posting your query on ChatDoctorAs you have mentioned that you have had breast cancer, there is a hereditary condition which increases the incidence of uterine cancer. This is the reason why your doctor advice you to get an endometrial biopsy to look for endometrial cancer. The red spots you are having can be a manifestation of an internal malignancy.Much cancer cause skin manifestations of this kind.Don't worry, wait for your biopsy report. Take care Chat Doctor. "
