  "A": "Good Day, ESR is a very nonspecific reading. A great number of things can raise these values, and one large value does not necessarily represent any significant illness or issues; it will not be enough to say anything is wrong or right. What it can do is signify that your body is in a more inflammatory/reactionary state than usual; but as I stated before this can be due to a number of things (Stress, elevated BP, viral or bacterial illness (even simple colds that you don't realize you have). Are you suffering any other symptoms? I hope this has helped, I wouldn't place too much emphasis on your ESR by itself, but if there are any other symptoms, I'd be happy to discuss these with you."
