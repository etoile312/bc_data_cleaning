  "Q": "Hi I m Shelby . I m young . I m only 16, but I really need help. I been on this birth control for about. Months then it started to mess up to where I had 3 periods in a month so I just stopped taking it. My doctor put me back on it and it s fine , but I m suppose to start my period.. I haven t. I also have upper pain in my stomach . It feels like it s bruised. It hurts to lay on my stomach. What could it be ?",
  "A": "Hi, Thanks for the query. Oral contraceptive pills can cause side effects like menstrual irregularities, pain abdomen, bloating sensation of the abdomen, breast tenderness etc. So what you are experiencing could be side effect of the pills. Usually these symptoms will subside soon without need of any medication. And also possibly you can get periods soon. If you do not get periods also you have to continue the pills as usual. But if the symptoms persist better to consult your doctor once and think about changing the pills. Take care."
