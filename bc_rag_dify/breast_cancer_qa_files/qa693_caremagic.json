  "A": "Hi, Though rarely, failure of tubal ligation(recanalization) is seen. (failure rate being 2-10 per 1000 cases) IN your case the symptoms you are suffering may be due to irregularity of menses due to hormonal imbalance OR pregnancy.  You can exclude pregnancy by blood Chat Doctor testing.  If the test is -ve, take Norethisterone 5Â mg pills, 1 twice day for 3 days. It will be followed by with Chat Doctor.  Please consult your doctor for detailed examination & advice as per need.  Thanks"
