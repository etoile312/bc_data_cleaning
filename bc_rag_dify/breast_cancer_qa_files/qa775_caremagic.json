  "A": "Welcome to ChatDoctorThis is called fibroadenomas which is benign condition and may be painful at times. This is related to your period and due to hormone imbalance. For armpit lump that is lymph node you require needle biopsy. For painful breast lumps take tablet Even 400Â mg daily for one month and painkillers during more severe pain. Good breast support bra should be used. But if armpit biopsy comes cancer you need surgery for breast along with armpit lymph node clearance. Regards"
