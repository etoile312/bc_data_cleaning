  "Q": "Estrogen is good for the skin, the largest organ of the body?  What other organs of the body are affected favorably by taking Estrogen?  I have been told Estrogen is good for the colon?  My e-mail address is  YYYY@YYYY What are the odds of getting breast cancer by taking estrogenThank you",
  "A": "Hi and welcome to Chat Doctor. Thanks for the query. Odds are very small, but there are scientific data which confirm that estrogen does increase risk for breast cancer. This is very small increase, but this is the fact. Also, it can cause blood clotting disorders. However, it is considered that benefits of estrogen are much higher than bad effects so if there is indication for it, it should be used. Wish you good health. Regards"
