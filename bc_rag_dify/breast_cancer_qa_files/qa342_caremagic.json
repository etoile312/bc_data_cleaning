  "Q": "Hello doctor! I m 25 years old. recently for the past 2 months i ve been having brown patches over my thighs and waistline which are very very itchy. The spots have now grew darker and bigger in size. Please advise me why this happens? I have been experiencing this after a train travel if I haven t mistaken. Would it be any insect infections like scabies?? Please help me with ur suggestions and what I should do to get rid of it. I also tried an anti fungal/anitbacterial cream called ONABET. Which didn t help in anyway.",
  "A": "Hi, You seem to have developed fungal infection. Fungal infection is usually itchy. It favors sites like inner thighs, groin and other body folds like maxilla, sub mammary folds etc. as patches and rings with redness, scaling and darkening of skin. Moisture from sweat and warmth of body folds encourages the fungus to grow.  I suggest you to take an oral antifungal like e.g. either Fluconazole or Itraconazole along with the application of a topical antifungal cream e.g. either Fluconazole 1% cream or Terminating 1% cream, twice daily for 2-4 weeks. In addition, I also suggest you to take an oral antihistamine e.g. Tab Cetirizine once a day for symptomatic relief from itching. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further."
