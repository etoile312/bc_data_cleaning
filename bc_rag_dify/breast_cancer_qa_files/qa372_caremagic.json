  "Q": "I am currently taking suboxone 8 mg. However, over the last 5 days, I have had major dental work. I had Eleven extractions. Six last Sat, five yesterday and after the extractions I immediately inserted my brand new smile :) The dentures fit and I promised my husband (and dentist!) that I would never complain... just so happy to have my smile back. I had been taking oxycodone for many years due to numerous issues from a gastric bypass (my body wasn t absorbing enough nutrients) as well as complications from chemo. I am 55yrs old. I never had a problem with opiates. My doctor retired (poor man had colon cancer). I live in CA and everybody swears by marijuana. Not for me. So for the last 8 months my G.P. has me taking suboxone 8mg and 800-2400mg of Ibuprophen. I have apt w/G.P. tomorrow he has always been very difficult when it comes to writing prescriptions. Just asking for an antibiotic has been like pulling teeth....! So, my question is.... can I stop the suboxone today and take an opiate tomorrow for a few days and then go back to the suboxone? My dentist wrote a prescription for tramadol?? But the pharmacy said the insurance company denied it. Are there ant other STRONG pain medications out there that I m not aware of? It hurts so badly and I am a bit nervous because my next issue is foot surgery. I have always had a very high tolerance to medications. The anesthesiologist at Mt. Sinai had to give me 3 injections of ?? to put me out before my mastectomy! I sound like a cry baby, but it really hurts! The dentist said it should take about a week to heal. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!",
  "A": "Hello, This would have to be done by a physician of course. The blocker in Suboxone is short-acting and 2 days at the very most (and more likely 12 hrs) would be enough to get the blocker out of the system.  The Suboxone is still there. It is a strong narcotic. It often helps the pain.  The first thing which you may have already done is to go with a heavy dose of anti-inflammatories since this does not interact with the Suboxone and is a strong pain reliever for dental pain. The Suboxone could be stopped BUT anyone on Suboxone is a high risk of having addiction problems when not on it. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Take care Chat Doctor. "
