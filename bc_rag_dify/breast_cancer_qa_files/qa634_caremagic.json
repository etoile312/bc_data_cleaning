  "A": "Welcome to Chat Doctor. Breast cancer that has spread to lung, liver,brain is stage 4 diseases and unfortunately outcome is very poor for this stage.  You should give her symptomatic mediation and all possible support in this stage. Patients like her who have advanced stage disease need good palliative care. It is treatment of problems patient is facing like pain, nausea, omitting etc. This treatment is more important to improve quality of life of patient. There are strong pan medications like morphine which can help her. It is good that she is getting pain medication. There are many pain medicine available and doctor can prescribe him appropriate medication in adequate dose so that he becomes pain free. Regards Regards"
