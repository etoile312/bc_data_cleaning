  "Q": "I found a lump on my breast 3 months ago and thought nothing of it. Three weeks ago I noticed several changes. There was a change in size of the lump & the breast, the nipple is flattened and slightly inverted, there is dimpling on the lower breast, hardening around the nipple, dull pain in the breast and under the correlating arm, and a blistery rash between the breasts. I went to my physician and an MRI and mammogram were referred. They are scheduled for next week. This seems like a long wait especially when a biopsy may be required after screening. That could take another week or two. Is this normal?",
  "A": "Hi Thanks for your query. Noted the history and understood the concerns. This is surely not normal. A lump in the breast with inverted nipple, hardness and all the changes are surely indicative of a cancer of the breast unless proved otherwise. When there is a wait the best way to get a referral for cancer surgeon and get at least FNAC of the lump so that you can get appropriate diagnosis and a plan of management. MRI and other investigations are to get a stage of the disease and thus changes plan according to the diagnosis thus made. If this turns out to be a benign lump still it is better to get an excision biopsy for two reasons:You get rid of the problems, lump is out, and thus the disease is out. You get the confirmed diagnosis. Take Care Regards "
