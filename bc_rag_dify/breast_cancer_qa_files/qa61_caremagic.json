  "Q": "Hi.. I am writting from bangladesh. I require medical assistance for breast cancer of one of my relative. Can u please tell me the procedure how to treat in your hospital as the patient will be coming from bangladesh..thanks...regards..billah",
  "A": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. Breast cancer if detected early, can have excellent prognosis with near normal life. So first thing to be done is staging of breast cancer in your patient. If patient is having stage 1-2 disease than surgical resection of tumor with unblock resection of axillary lymph nodes are needed. If patient is having stage 3-4 disease than chemotherapy, radiotherapy, hormonal therapy and debunking surgery are the option. So in India, I advise you to consult Tata memorial cancer hospital, Bombay for management of breast cancer. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wishing good health to your relative. Thanks."
