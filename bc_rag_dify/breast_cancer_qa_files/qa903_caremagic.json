  "Q": "I have a period every 3 months and this is the first month i start to not have one. I have been reading a lot of things on the internet about pregnancy and signs. I have been having bad stomach pains, bad back pains, and now my legs are like cold skin deep and i took a test but it was negative. I still think i am because i still feel the same as i did before the test. Does this mean im pregnant?",
  "A": "His have gone through your complaints. Sorry to say this that you may not be pregnant now with this history .you are saying you read in internet. Not having periods is not only symptom that will tel pregnancy.in the presence of missed period, breast tenderness, nausea and vomiting if present go for urine/ blood pregnancy test or ultrasonogram. First one thing I want to tell you that evaluate for why you are getting once in 3 months.it requires complete work up and then It's important to regulate your periods. If this is done definitely the chance of conception increases. Consult Chat Doctor. Thank youRegardsVasundhara"
