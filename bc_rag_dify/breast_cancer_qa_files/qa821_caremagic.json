  "Q": "About a week ago I had a small rash under my arm. The rash only lasted a few days but now it is itching like crazy. My whole arm pit and out to my breast has a very weird type feeling. It looks like leather but purple in color. My Doctor gave me some type of cream to put on it but it is not helping at all. Could this be shingles or possibly breast cancer? I just turned 58",
  "A": "Hello and welcome to ChatDoctorIt sounds like you have developed an allergy. Was there any history of taking any new medication, or applying anything prior to the rash? Any history of long sun exposure? Any food or Chat Doctor.  You can start applying Clobetasol cream lightly twice a day foe 7-10 days and observe. Also take antihistamine like Exocet 5Â mg for the itching. Check for spread of the rash or new ones appearing. If there is no improvement do consult a dermatologist and consider infection as well. A biopsy of the leathery area maybe one if needed as advised. Hope this helps. While on treatment, avoid any items which you are generally allergic to and do not scratch the area. Use a mild soap."
