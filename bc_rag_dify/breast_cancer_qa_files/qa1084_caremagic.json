Just had an abdominal ultrasound without any results yet. pain goes to right lower abdomen and also shoots to the back left. Triglycerides=315, cholesterol 220. 20 lbs overweight. 39 years old. 2 kids. No complications. No other health issues. Xray was negative for a stone.",
  "A": "Hello! Thank you for the query. Such symptoms are most likely caused by urinary tract infection. Due to bacteria presence in the urine you get lower abdominal pain, back pain. You should also have frequent urinating, burning while urinating. Fever can appear. Please consult your doctor and have urinalysis done. If bacteria will be present, antibiotic treatment is necessary. You should also increase mineral water intake and start cranberries supplementation. Hope this will help. Regards."
