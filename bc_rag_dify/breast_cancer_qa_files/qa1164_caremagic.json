  "Q": "Hello, i was diagnosed with mastocytosis as a child, it went away by age 6. is it possible to be having papules erupting now at age 30? I also have plaque psoriasis , are they related?",
  "A": "What were u exactly diagnosed? Since u recovered from it completely I assume u had solitary mastectomy or urticaria pigmentosa. If u have been developing new onset pa pules, it would be quite difficult to say what it is without seeing u, but there is a possibility that they may be lesions of psoriasis, since you're a patient of plaque type psoriasis. Sending pictures would help. There is no connection between psoriasis and mastocytosis.  Chat Doctor. "
