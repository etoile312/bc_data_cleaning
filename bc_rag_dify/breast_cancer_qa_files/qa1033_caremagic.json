  "Q": "Hello Doctor, My 17 year old daughter has a solid pea sized lump in her breast which does not hurt, she also has a swollen armpit but no other symptoms. When she was 11, she had to have three cysts aspirated. The Doctor has referred my Daughters case as urgent and we have an appoinment in one week. I am worried sick as this time the lump feels different, hard and fixed with no pain, plus she has a swollen armpit.  When she had the cysts before they were far bigger and they did not feel as hard and they were not fixed, they also caused her alot of pain.The lump is in the same breast but in the upper right part of the breast. I know the doctor is thinking breast cancer by the look on his face and the fact he was lost for words. Please can you tell me in your honest opinion what you think? Or if this lump is benign...what else could it be? if this is a Cyst, why are the symptoms so different?  Many thanks for your time",
  "A": "Hi. Noted the history of Aspirated Cysts, now pea sized lump in right breast and swollen armpits. Cancer is least likely almost not heard of at the age of 17 years. The lump in the breast can be cyst which has re-appeared and got fixed due to previous aspiration tract. This is not frankly infected hence appears hard and does not hurt. Simple ultrasonography and guided FNAC will give the diagnosis. The swollen armpit can be due to lymph nodes secondary to the breast lesion or have been a part of hi Chat Doctor.  Ultrasonography will help here too-go for an FNAC of the armpit swelling too."
