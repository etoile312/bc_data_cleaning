  "A": "Hi, Ovral-G is a combined hormonal medication commonly prescribed to prevent pregnancy, to regularize the menstrual and other conditions. Its common side effects include nausea, vomiting, headache, bloating, breast tenderness, swelling of the ankles / feet (fluid retention), or weight change may occur. It may also cause bleeding between periods, irregular or delayed periods. I advise you to consult your doctor for further evaluation and to rule out other causes of delayed period and for possible treatment to induce period. Hope I have answered your question. Let me know if I can assist you further. "
