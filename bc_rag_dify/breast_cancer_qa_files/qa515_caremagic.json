  "Q": "I have not been ovulating regularly over the past several months. My doctor has recently put me on femara which I started on days 3-7 of my most recent period which began January 9th and ended January 16th. I would like to know approximatly when I can expect ovulation and when to have sex with my husband so that we get pregnant? Thanks",
  "A": "Hi, Firstly, Female is CONTRAINDICATED when you are trying to conceive. It is used to treat certain types of breast cancer that are estrogen dependent. So, make sure that your doctor has prescribed you the same medication. If on the other hand you are put on Fatimid, it is used for induction of ovulation. Ovulation usually occurs between 5-10 days after the treatment, and you can expect better chances of conception if intercourse is practiced at least on alternate days during this period. Please get further clarifications from your doctor. Take care."
