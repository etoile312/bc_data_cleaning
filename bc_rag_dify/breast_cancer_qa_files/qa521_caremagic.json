  "Q": "hi my friends mother has breast cancer however after and operation and chemo she was fine...she started falling sick after a month and was dizzy and weak..jus a day before her radiation was ment to start she was admitted in a hospital...she woke up to go to the bath room in the night and fell down and hurt her head...and in the morning she started to projectile vomit...??? is it because of a concussion???..or der is more to it???",
  "A": "Hi ! She needs continuous observation to rule out a significant head injury. Vomiting could be due to a concussion or any level of intro cranial hemorrhage. In that case you have to see her level of consciousness as well which also fades away in case of a significant head injury. I am not aware as to the stage of breast cancer she had. In advanced stage, we have to also consider any possibility of intro cranial metastatic space occupying lesion where she can get this symptom. If the symptoms persist, I would suggest going for a CENT skull to rule out these possibilities, but only after consulting your treating doctor. Wishing her an early recovery."
