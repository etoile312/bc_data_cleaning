  "Q": "I am 20 years old and have a two year old son. I have a petite body build and have not gained much weight lately. I got one lone stretch mark on my right breast while pregnant and it hasn t bothered me until recently. It is extremely painful and seems to be getting larger; it is hollow-like and looks bruised. My right breast hurts pretty much all the time but every now and then, I will get a sharp stabbing pain where the stretch mark is, sometimes it s so bad I almost cry and can t breathe. When I think cancer, I think of a tumor, so I have no clue what this hollow spot could be!! Please help..",
  "A": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your situation and problem. No need to worry much for cancer.  As your age is too young to have cancer. Cancer lumps are generally not painful so again fewer chances of malignancy in your case. In my opinion you should first get done mammography of right breast. This will tell you about your breast lump. I think you are having abscess or infected cyst which causes so much pain. So no need to worry about cancer just get done mammography and start treatment accordingly."
