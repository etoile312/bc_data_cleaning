  "Q": "Im having a dull throbbing ache from my chin down and across the front of my neck, a small module was found on my thyroid and Im waiting to see an endocrinologist in 2 weeks for that, but Im worried its more cuz when he talked with my PCP he said I shouldnt have pain with the nodule. I am a three year breast cancer survivor. Could this be something worse ? What do you think this is?",
  "A": "Dear Rousseau, Mostly painful nodules anywhere in the body are non-cancerous and the inflammatory condition has to be given the first thought. You may be having infected thyroid cyst. Get ultrasound examination done or needle aspiration done to find out what is the problem. Even a secondary deposit from the primary breast cancer will not be painful. Your primary physician will guide you through, and you need not work as regards cancer. Truly, Chat Doctor.  Ticku"
