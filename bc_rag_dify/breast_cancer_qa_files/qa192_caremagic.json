  "Q": "it has been about a week now that i have a hard painful lump under my skin under my left armpit.  it is about the size of a pea.  yesterday i noticed a very small lump on my right boob which is kinda of a blothcy red around it. do you think i shoud go see a doctor?",
  "A": "Hi.it is best if you consult with a doctor, preferably a general surgeon, for medical and physical examination. It could be a benign breast lesion, but the possibility of other breast tumors should always be considered. It could be a fibrous, a fibrotic lesion or other breast tumors. These lesions are best evaluated clinically. Further diagnostic examinations, such as breast ultrasound and mammography, will be requested as needed. this diagnostics also evaluate the axillary area. The lump on your armpit may or may not be related to your breast lesion. Regular breast examination and follow-up with your doctor is highly recommended in these cases.  Management (medical and/or surgical) will be directed accordingly. Hope this helps. Good day!!~ Chat Doctor. "
