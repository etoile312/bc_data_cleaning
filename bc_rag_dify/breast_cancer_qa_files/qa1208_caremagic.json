  "Q": "Hello, i am from Romania. I had in April a breast surgery, bening tumor finally. I had in that time a strong muscle contracture when they tried to eliminate lymph (I was afraid of the needle!). I didn t know that I will have lately a big problem with my arm! Now I make terapy (kineto+massage) for recovery my blocked arm (they said). During these 3 weeks no changes. Do you consider i need infiltrations with corticoids?",
  "A": "Hello, Its a matter of happiness that your tumor was benign and non-harmful in nature. Looking at your detail it looks that most probable reason behind your arm contracture was lack of proper physiotherapy during recovery period. In such cases the physiotherapy is the best option, although it may take some time as recovery is gradual in nature. Meanwhile, you may add a muscle relaxant like thiocolchicoside or chlorzoxazone on recommendation of your doctor to relieve muscle spasm. Hope I have answered your question. Let me know if I can assist you further. "
