  "A": "Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor. You have infected breast cyst.Don't worry it is treatable. It mainly occurs after the age of 35 years. Benign breast cyst also found in pregnant and non-pregnant women both. Simple treatment is warm compresses. Take tablet paracetamol or ibuprofen for pain. Consult your breast surgeon for Chat Doctor. Ask the doctor about other lab test required or not after examination like biopsy, FNAC, sonography or mammogram just to rule out other conditions. Hope this will help you. Thanks for contacting. Take care..."
