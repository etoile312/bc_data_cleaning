  "Q": "Hi Dr, can you help me? Or point me in right direction? I have been diagnosed with endometriosis had a lap op last year meanwhile I was prescribed Yaz flex birth control to help with symptoms. Only thing is I can t stand it I am bloated uncomfortable, have a dragging sensation after being on my feet all day. Also boobs very tender sore, hard as rocks once a month in line with cycle I m not having because of Yaz. I was told to take as long as I could to get my body in sync with it, I lasted 93 days then had to take a break, 4 days of no pills to have a period. No period happened, I did pregnancy test came back negative still no period to date 10 days ago (I ve stopped taking yaz now). Help what other treatments are there? What birth control tablet should I try next? Appreciate any input? Many thanks Catherine",
  "A": "Hello, and I hope I can help you today.First, the treatment of endometriosis with continuous birth control does help a lot of women with the pain associated with endometriosis. However, the side effects of bloating and breast tenderness can be due to the birth control, and the fact that you are taking them continuously compounds the symptoms over time. Secondly, many women will have their period delayed after stopping birth control pills, especially if the pill has suppressed your period.  So the fact that your cycle has not yet returned after stopping the Yam is not unusual. Even though you had bothersome side effects from the Yam, there are many brands of birth control pills with different active ingredients that you can try to take for continuous use.  The pill brands vary in name by the country in which you live, but a pill with the active ingredient levonorgestrel is the most popular type of extended cycle pill in the U.S. and I suggest you discuss changing to a brand with this active ingredient with your local physician. I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. Best wishes,"
