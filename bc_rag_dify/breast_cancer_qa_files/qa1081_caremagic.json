  "Q": "My wife has some odd symptoms. Two weeks ago she had about 3 days of vomiting and diarrhea. Then 4 days of severly bloodshot eyes (pink eye?). Now she has leakage from her left breast, very sore left hip, swollen right knee, sore ankles and two of the toes on her left foot are swollen. Could this be Lyme disease? Thanks for your assistance. Ian.",
  "A": "Ello, Thanks for writing to us. There are a few facts that I need to know to comment better. I would like to know if she has been trying to conceive, has a missed period or is ovulating now. I would also like to know the duration of the discharge and if there is any feeling of pain or lump in the breast. Ovulation can cause nipple discharge in many and so is an early pregnancy state. A urine pregnancy test reads well when done 3-7 days after a missed period with a fresh early morning sample of urine. If repeated tests done as per instructions are negative, pregnancy is unlikely. Yet, estimation of serum beta-ChatDoctor can give a definite conclusion. I would also ask her to see a specialist for an examination to see if there is anything else causing the discharge. Hope I have clarified your query. Please feel free to contact for further information. I will be happy to help."
