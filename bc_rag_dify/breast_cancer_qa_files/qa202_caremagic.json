  "Q": "I have a sudden sharp pain in my right boob on the upper left side. IT has been going on for 3 days. It hurts bad enough to the point of crying at times. I called my doctor who recommended I have a mammogram done. Its hard for me to get into the doctor because of work. DO you think it is necessary that I go to the er or wait and see if it goes away in a few days. I did a breast check (which I do not do as I should so I am not sure exactly what I am looking for) I didn t feel anything I am 27 years old",
  "A": "Howell come to ChatDoctorYou had a history of breast pain and in my opinion this could be nonspecific pain and this would come around chances of muscular pain is very likely, there must not be any lump inside else you would have discussed here, in my opinion better to wait some time and no need to hurry, can be managed with analgesic and the best choice would be Tab Ibuprofen 400 mg, three times in day, hope this helps."
