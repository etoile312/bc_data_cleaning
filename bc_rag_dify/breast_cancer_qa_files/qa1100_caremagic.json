  "Q": "I have been taking Anastrozole for almost 2 months now and have experianced extreme pain in my joints My doctor says that is normal and to tough it out and take Aleve I understand that the joint pain because of the side affect on the bones Just wondering when it should be a concern for me after toughing it out thanks",
  "A": "Pain in back, bone or muscle are one of the side effects that may occur with consumption of Anastrazole. However, these effects are mild and reduces down or are completely gone with the discontinuation of the Chat Doctor.  Also, minor side effects should not bother much to cause discontinuation. Besides, pain experienced is not extreme, so it might be some other reason like a reduced bone density, as commonly seen in patients with breast cancer. Go for a bone density test and get treated from an endocrinologist or a PMR physician."
