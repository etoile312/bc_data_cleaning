  "Q": "My sister was diagnosed with Stage IV breast cancer April 2009.  She had double masectomy and several bouts of Chemo with Radiation.  Spots have been detected on her brain and liver.  She became jaundice over the past week.  Her legs and abdomen are really swollen.  Her Dr. did a physical exam today and said that the Liver is enlarged quite a bit from his last physical.  She will be getting scans at the end of the week.  I do not live near my Sister but want to see her...is there any indication with this how long she has??",
  "A": "Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. She had history of breast cancer. Now if she has spots detected in brain and liver then there is chance of metastatic carcinoma from breast. It is considered as stage 4 cancer and prognosis remains poor.  Life expectancy is not good.  You should go to see her as soon as possible. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health."
