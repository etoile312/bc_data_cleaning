  "A": "Hi, In the current scenario, you can wait for your cycle as it is almost due and then go for a urine pregnancy test 3-7 days later if you miss it. If you wish for an earlier and better confirmation, you can go for the serum beta-ChatDoctor title. Please see your health care provider for a physical exam and get a trans-vaginal sonogram if you miss a period. Your symptoms are not specific to early pregnancy; they can be pre-menstrual as well. Hope your query is clarified. Take care."
