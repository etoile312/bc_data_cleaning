  "Q": "I am 59. I have a fibroid tumor that measured 6cm in 2013. It now measures 8 cm. my gynecologist is recommending a complete hysterectomy. I have very few symptoms, spotting occasionally. My mother, 79 has just been diagnosed w ovarian cancer. This is a concern for me. What should I do?",
  "A": "Hi, Thanks for writing in. There are two parts to your query. For your fibroid which is progressively increasing in size, it is possibly causing a lot of discomfort and bleeding during your periods. In this case, if you have finished your family and do not desire to have nay more child Chat Doctor.  As you say that you only have spotting then you can choose for a mastectomy procedure or arterial embolization instead of hysterectomy. Please discuss the treatment options with your doctor and then take an informed decision. Regarding your mother who is confirmed to have an ovarian cancer, if it is in the first stage then surgery is compulsory. Even after surgery she might be given chemotherapy and radiation therapy to suppress the cancer cells. Since you have not mentioned the stage of cancer in your mother I guess that it is stage 1 cancer. Treatment should be given completely, and she should follow up with her doctors when required. Please do not worry."
