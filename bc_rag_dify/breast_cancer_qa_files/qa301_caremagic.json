  "Q": "Hi I am Stella Mary,23 yrs female.weight -60 kg.height-165 cm. I got married 11 months back. for the fist 9 months my husband and I were not planning to have a baby and we avoided by using condoms and safe period. Now for the Past two months we are planning to have a baby but i didn t conceive. My problems are: 1) i never attain orgasm during sex even after 15-20 min,though my husband attains. but i always attain orgasm if i masturbate. -Is this a problem with me or my husband fails to stimulate me? -though i don t attain orgasm with him,i feel satisfied and it gives me a pleasure.but Can i get pregnant only if i attain orgasm? 2) my cycles are mostly regular-30 to 32 days(since i attained menarche),normal flow,no dysmenorrhea.Occasionally when i am deeply emotionally stressed periods gets delayed further by 2 or 3 days,but never more than 35 days.all my cycles are initially slightly painful(not severe dysmenorrhea).i have mid cycle pain,irritability and breast tenderness just before my periods. -am i suffering from PMS? - can i assume that i am ovulating because of all these?or should i get tests done? -it has been just two months since we are planning for a baby.so should i wait more or can we consult a doctor after a month,since it is one year after marriage? THANK YOU",
  "A": "Hi greetings. You are absolutely normal as far sex is concerned. There are more than 40 of women who will not get orgasm during intercourse, and they need to be stimulated. You both can involve in foreplay for more than 15 to 20 min and masturbating by clitoral stimulation will definitely reach orgasm for you. Since females can have multiple orgasm intercourse can be immediately followed by your orgasm. So that both of you will be satisfied. Coming to fertility. Your husband can get a semen analysis done from a very good laboratory who are familiar with semen analysis as there are lots off fallacies with semen analysis. If it is normal you should be having daily intercourse from 10 the day of your cycle for 10 to 12 days continuously. Usually ovulation happens 14 days prior to expected date of menses if your cycles are regular. Since it cannot be predicted it is better to start intercourse from 10th day. You can try for 3 months like this if semen analysis is normal. Still no pregnancy it is better to get it evaluated. Day 2 hormone analysis, ultrasound scan etc .hope you are convinced. Regards"
