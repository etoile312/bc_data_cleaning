  "Q": "I was on Alesse for a year.  After 1 month I began to lose my hair.  Fast.  I lost tons of weight.  Around the 3rd month, my period flow began to diminish from a moderate to light.  The amount of days also reduced from a full 7 to 3 and then to none.  I did not get my period after stopping Alesse for 3 years.  Yes 3 years.  During this time I my hair continued to fall out and I gained weight.  135lbs to 177.  I have not been able to burn the weight off no matter how much exercise i do or eat healthy.  Something I have always done.  During this time, I also experienced Menopausal symptoms like severe hot flashes.  It has been 8 years and I rarely get my period. Approximately 9 times.  Is there anything I can do to correct this besides going back on a BC pill, progesterone and Metformin?  Is there something more natural?",
