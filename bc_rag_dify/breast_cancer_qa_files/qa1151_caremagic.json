  "Q": "Hi, I took the morning after pill, Levonelle on the 3rd June following unprotected sex with my boyfriend on the night of the 2nd. I think my period is due in the next couple of days but I have had period style cramping for a week now but with no period. I took a pregnancy test last week but it was negative. Just wondering whether the Levonelle could still be causing the cramping nearly 3 weeks after taking this or if these could be implantation cramps?",
  "A": "Hi, I have gone through your query and I can understand your anxiety. Levonelle pills or morning after pills has common side effects like stomach upset, breast tenderness, tiredness, lower abdominal pain, irregular menstrual cycle varies between spotting to heavier flow. Your symptoms might be due to the pills, as the day of intercourse and menstrual cycle are nearby there is no possibility of pregnancy.Also, you are missing your periods for 3Â weeks, i advice you to do serum beta Chat Doctor to rule out pregnancy.
