  "Q": "Hello.. I was in the contraceptive pill cilest... I get migraines, my bp increased slightly and i have water retention in my right foot. Could all these side effects be related to the pill? What other pill could i take instead if cilest is the reason for all of this",
  "A": "Hello, Yes, Vilest pill can cause these side effects. Vilest is a combined contraceptive pill containing an estrogen and progesterone. The most common side effects of combined contraceptive pills like Vilest include headache (migraine), high blood pressure, swollen feet (fluid retention), breast tenderness and the most serious one being an increased risk of getting a blood clot in a vein, such as a deep vein thrombosis (clot in the leg) or pulmonary embolism (clot in the lungs). All these side effects appear to be due to estrogen present in the pills. To overcome these side effects you may start taking the progesterone-only contraceptive pill (after consulting a doctor) which does not contain any estrogen and hence less like to cause those side effects listed in your query. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Take care Chat Doctor. "
