  "Q": "I had my annual mammogram in which they noticed something a little different behind my left nipple.  I then had an ultrasound and then a MRI in which they determined to be nothing.  I was then having a slight clear sticky discharge but now it is bleeding spontaneously.  They want to perform a galactogram(?).  Can this mean cancer?",
  "A": "Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. You may have some breast disease or nipple pathology. You should go for biopsy or fine needle aspiration cytology of that lump. It will give you exact diagnosis whether it is cancer or other pathology. Then you should take treatment accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have any doubts then contact me at bit.ly/ Chat Doctor. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health."
