  "Q": "Hi I have discovered a large lump (rather visable) behind my ear and where my hair begins, it has been there for 2 weeks (that is when i felt it).  now there is one above it and a small one below.  I went to my gp, he did blood tests, he says all is clear, no infections, no cancers etc.  he has now put me on penasilin medicine for 2 weeks.  He says if theis medicine does not work, we will do a biopsy.  I have had abnormal cells before, and have had to do a hystorectomy when i was 26.   My grandfather died of colon cancer, my aunt died of breast cancer, my mother had cervical cancer and my other gran had cancer all over her body.  I am now 32, about 5.2.  My question is that if these lumps do not go away, and the blood tests were clear, is it possible to still have cancer?",
  "A": "Hi, Thanks for writing in. Cancer is a diagnosis that can appear in many ways, however if you are having swelling that appeared within days then it is most likely that you have an infection. Cancer will not appear quickly and takes time. Another point which is important concern if you had pain in the lumps. Any pain is usually an infection and cancers are usually not painful in the beginning. It is most likely to be lymph node enlargement at the back of the ear. This is because there are retroauricular lymph nodes in that location, and they can get enlarged due to infection. If possible, please get an ultrasound scan of the area to know exactly the findings and cause of lumps and continue taking medicine given by your doctor for a week. It will most likely treat your lumps. Please do not worry."
