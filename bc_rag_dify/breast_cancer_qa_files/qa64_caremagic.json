  "Q": "Hi, I have had a lump under arm for quite a few years but it seems to have increased in size. It is about the size of a golf ball and hurts when I press on it. I went to doctor years ago who pressed on it and told me to come back if bothers me. Is it something I should worry about? I m 30 and mother had breast cancer not genetic type. Thank you",
  "A": "HI. Thanks for your query. Read and understood that you have a big lump under arm for quite some time and seems to be increasing in size. As your Doctor said in the past I would advise you the following:Since this is not a normal part of the body, it is Thebes policy to get such lumps removed for 2 reasons:1. You get rid f the mass which is not a normal part of the body and2. The most important past is that you get a confirmed diagnosis as to the nature of ti whether benign or cancer ((malignant)The preliminary tests of mammography, ultrasonography and FNAC does help in proper diagnosis but the excision biopsy if the only full proof method."
