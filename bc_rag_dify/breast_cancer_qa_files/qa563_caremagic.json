  "Q": "Good Morning Doctor, I would like to check regarding fibroidenosis and fibroiodenoma. In july2012, I had done my mammogram and USG and it was showing two Brest lumps on right breast but in diagnosis written as fibrodenema. Now I have repeated my USG yesterday and have three lumps in right and one in left breasts. Am having pain from the week of ovulation till the menstruation on both breasts. Is this can be turned cancer? Do this need needle incision for further check up? Do I need to change my lifestyle to avoid such things.",
  "A": "Dear Ma'am, Sorry to hear about your complaints, but I am glad that you are seeking medical advice for the same. The symptoms you are describing are typical of fibroadenomas, which is associated with pain in the breasts which increases before menses and subsides after the periods, only to recur again after z few days. It is also associated with multiple small lumps/ cysts in the breast. Majority of the times this condition is not associated with any risk of malignancy. You just need to follow up regularly with your surgeon and get regular (yearly) USGS done. For the pain the doctor can start you on It E (Evian) capsules and oil of evening primrose capsules. These help in reducing the pain. Other measure you should take are --reduce caffeine intake-wear a comfortable breast support (like a sports bra) Usually this condition subsides with time as it occurs due to hormonal imbalance. Hope you get well soon. Rohan KhandelwalBreast Surgeon"
