  "Q": "I am 5 weeks and 2 days pregnant, apart from breast tenderness/ pain, urination (i generally drink lot of water), have no other symptoms. Had a miscarriage last year and very worried with no symptoms whether I am ok or not. I had a hard stool today but after an hour had a soft stool again, which hadnt happened since I got to know that I am pregnant.",
  "A": "Hello, I can understand your apprehension given your past history. It is always not necessary to feel all the symptoms of pregnancy. If the hormone levels are well maintained and the sonogram shows good fetal cardiac activity and fetal growth, you need not worry. You need to take adequate rest, healthy diet, avoid stress and have regular follow up. Passing frequent stool is not a symptom and increase in the dietary fiber or infection should be considered in addition to the possibility of prostaglandin effect. Please see your specialist for further help. Take care."
